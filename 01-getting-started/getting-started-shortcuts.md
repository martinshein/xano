## 1. AI-Powered Schema Design

**Think of this as having a database architect on your team.** Instead of manually creating tables and fields, you can describe what you want in plain English, and AI will build it for you.

### Using the AI Database Assistant

The AI Database Assistant understands your business needs and translates them into proper database structure. It follows database best practices automatically, saving you from common design mistakes.

**Real-World Example**: Instead of manually creating a "Customer Orders" table with proper relationships, you could say: "I need to track customer orders for my e-commerce site with products, quantities, and shipping addresses."

**How to Use It Effectively:**

1. **Be descriptive**: "Create a project management system with tasks, team members, and deadlines"
2. **Include relationships**: "Connect customers to their orders and order items"
3. **Mention specific requirements**: "Track inventory with low-stock alerts"

**Example Prompts:**
- "Build a booking system for a wellness spa with services, appointments, and customer profiles"
- "Create a content management system with articles, authors, and categories"
- "Design a membership database with different tiers and billing cycles"

### Approval and Review Process

**Smart Review Process:**

The AI suggests changes step-by-step, allowing you to:
- Review each table structure before approval
- Understand the relationships being created
- Choose whether to include API endpoints automatically
- Make adjustments before finalizing

**Pro Tip**: When creating tables, select "Create table and APIs" to automatically generate endpoints for your no-code tools to connect to.

### Iterative Design

**Iterative Design**: You can pause, test, and return to refine your schema. The AI remembers your context and continues from where you left off.

**Integration Benefits:**
- Generated APIs work immediately with WeWeb for frontend display
- Database triggers can feed into n8n workflows
- Structured data is ready for Make automation scenarios

## 2. CSV Data Import

**Like moving from a filing cabinet to a digital system** - bring all your spreadsheet data into Xano with full validation and error handling.

### Enterprise-Grade Import Features

**Enterprise-Grade Importing:**

- **Scalable**: Handle millions of records without affecting your live application
- **Intelligent Schema Detection**: Automatically identifies data types and creates appropriate fields
- **Flexible Operations**: Create new tables, append to existing ones, or update records
- **Background Processing**: Large imports (5,000+ records) run in the background with email notifications

**Perfect for No-Code Workflows:**
- Import customer data from existing CRM exports
- Bring in product catalogs from e-commerce platforms
- Transfer user data from other applications
- Migrate historical data for reporting

**Common Use Cases:**
- **E-commerce**: Product catalogs, customer lists, order histories
- **SaaS Applications**: User profiles, usage data, subscription information
- **Content Sites**: Article databases, author profiles, category structures

### Creating New Tables from CSV

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Access the Import Tool**: Navigate to your database and click "Add Table"

2. **Choose Import Method**: Select "Import Data" → "CSV file option"

3. **Upload Your File**: Drag and drop or browse for your CSV file

**Supported File Requirements:**
- UTF-8 encoding (most modern exports use this automatically)
- Comma-separated values (not semicolon or other separators)
- First row must contain column headers
- Consistent number of columns per row

4. **Review and Configure**: Preview the first 100 rows and configure:
   - **Data Types**: Xano automatically detects text, numbers, dates, etc.
   - **Primary Key**: Choose an existing field or let Xano create one
   - **Table Name**: Give your table a meaningful name

**Smart Data Type Detection:**
- Dates are automatically recognized and converted
- Numbers vs. text are intelligently distinguished
- Boolean values (true/false, yes/no) are detected
- Email addresses are identified for validation

5. **Complete the Import**: Click "Upload" and monitor progress
   - Small files (under 5,000 records): Import immediately
   - Large files: Background processing with email notification
   - Real-time progress tracking in workspace settings

### Adding Records to Existing Tables

**Expanding Your Data**: Add new records to existing tables by accessing the import option from within the table.

**Column Mapping**: Xano automatically maps CSV columns to existing table fields, but you can:
- Manually adjust mappings if column names don't match exactly
- Skip columns that aren't needed
- Map multiple CSV columns to single database fields

**Use Cases:**
- Monthly data updates from external systems
- Periodic customer list refreshes
- Adding new product inventory from suppliers

### Updating Existing Records

**Bulk Data Updates**: Modify existing records by including an `id` field in your CSV.

**How It Works:**
- CSV must include the record ID for each row to update
- Xano matches the ID and updates only the specified fields
- Records not in the CSV remain unchanged
- Missing fields in CSV are ignored (not overwritten with blank values)

**Practical Applications:**
- Update product prices from supplier feeds
- Refresh customer contact information
- Bulk status changes for orders or users

### CSV Format Requirements

**Technical Specifications:**

✅ **Correct Format Requirements:**
- **Separator**: Commas only (not semicolons or tabs)
- **Headers**: First row contains column names
- **Consistency**: Same number of fields in each row
- **Encoding**: UTF-8 (handles international characters)
- **Text Wrapping**: Use double quotes for text containing commas

**Platform-Specific Export Instructions:**

**Google Sheets** (Recommended):
- File → Download → Comma separated values (.csv)
- Automatically uses UTF-8 encoding

**Excel for Windows**:
- Save As → CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited)
- Avoid regular "CSV" option

**Excel for Mac**:
- File → Export → CSV UTF-8

**Numbers (Mac)**:
- File → Export To → CSV → Text Encoding: UTF-8

**Airtable**:
- Grid view → Share → CSV export (built-in UTF-8)

**Validation Tips:**
- Open CSV in a text editor to verify comma separation
- Check that quotes are properly paired
- Ensure consistent column count across all rows
- Verify special characters display correctly

**Sample CSV Format:**
```csv
name,email,age,active
John Doe,john@example.com,30,true
Jane Smith,jane@example.com,25,false
```

## 5. Database Triggers and Automated Workflows

**Think of database triggers as smart sensors** - they automatically detect when data changes and kick off workflows, notifications, or integrations without any manual intervention.

### Setting Up Database Triggers

**Access Point**: Each table has its own trigger settings accessible via the settings icon.

**Trigger Creation Process:**
1. Click the settings gear icon on any table
2. Select "+ Add Database Trigger"
3. Configure trigger conditions and actions
4. Test and activate the trigger

### Trigger Configuration Options

**Data Source Targeting:**
- Apply to all data sources (production, development, testing)
- Target specific environments only
- Useful for separating live triggers from testing triggers

**Action Types and Use Cases:**

| Trigger Type | When It Fires | Common Applications |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Insert** | New record created | Welcome emails, inventory alerts, user onboarding |
| **Update** | Existing record modified | Status change notifications, audit logging |
| **Delete** | Record removed | Cleanup tasks, archive notifications |
| **Truncate** | All records cleared | System reset procedures, maintenance alerts |

**Real-World Automation Examples:**
- **E-commerce**: Order created → Send confirmation email via n8n
- **SaaS**: User upgraded → Update billing in external system
- **Content**: Article published → Notify social media automation
- **CRM**: Lead status changed → Trigger follow-up sequence

### Advanced Filtering and Conditions

**Smart Conditional Logic:**
- **Field-Based Conditions**: Only trigger when specific fields meet criteria
- **Value Comparisons**: Greater than, less than, equals, contains
- **Status-Based**: Only for certain status changes or user types
- **Complex Logic**: Combine multiple conditions with AND/OR operators

**Filter Examples:**
- **High-Value Orders**: Only trigger for orders over $500
- **VIP Customers**: Only for users with premium status
- **Status Changes**: Only when order status changes to "shipped"
- **New Subscriptions**: Only for users subscribing to specific plans

**Integration Benefits:**
- Triggers work seamlessly with n8n webhooks
- Direct integration with Make automation scenarios
- Can call external APIs or internal Xano functions
- Perfect for WeWeb real-time updates

### Trigger Data and Workflow Integration

**Available Data Variables:**

| Variable | Description | Available For | Use Cases |
|----------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| `new` | Current record data | Insert, Update | Send data to external systems, create related records |
| `old` | Previous record data | Update, Delete | Compare changes, backup deleted data, audit trails |
| `action` | Trigger type | All triggers | Conditional logic, different handling per action |
| `data_source` | Environment info | All triggers | Environment-specific processing |

**Workflow Integration Patterns:**

**With n8n:**
```javascript
// Trigger webhook with record data
{
  "trigger_type": "{{action}}",
  "record_data": "{{new}}",
  "previous_data": "{{old}}"
}
```

**With Make/Zapier:**
- Use webhook triggers to receive database change notifications
- Parse record data for use in subsequent automation steps
- Implement conditional logic based on trigger type

**With WeWeb:**
- Real-time frontend updates when data changes
- Automatic UI refresh for data-driven components
- User notification systems
