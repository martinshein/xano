Get Started Assistant 
=====================
Build a Workspace with AI
When you create a new workspace in Xano, you can either start from scratch, or use our AI copilot to build your database and basic CRUD endpoints for you.
<div>
1
###  
During setup, make sure to choose Create With AI
2
###  
Provide the AI with its first instructions.
There are a few different ways you can work with the AI generator.
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    **Start with a template**
    -   ::: 
        ::: 
        :::
        :::
        ::: 
        Choose from any of the starter templates, and converse with the AI to make it your own.
        :::
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    **Tell it about what you want to build.**
    -   ::: 
        ::: 
        :::
        :::
        ::: 
        Start a conversation with the AI generator and let it know what your goals are. It can recommend database design strategies to you, and implement them for you right away.
        :::
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    **Tell it exactly the database structure you have in mind**
    -   ::: 
        ::: 
        :::
        :::
        ::: 
        This is especially useful if you are already familiar with app development, or maybe you\'ve done the design outside of Xano already --- just tell the AI what tables you want in plain language, and it will do the heavy lifting for you.
