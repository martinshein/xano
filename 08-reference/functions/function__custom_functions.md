Custom Functions 
================
Build business logic once and reuse it in multiple places
**Quick Summary**
Custom functions are very similar to your APIs --- they have inputs, a
function stack, and a response. However, they can not be called
externally. Instead, custom functions allow you to build something and
use it in other places, while maintaining it in a centralized location.
What is a custom function?
Custom functions can be thought of as a building block for the rest of
your backend. You can build a custom function just like an API endpoint,
and insert that custom function into other function stacks, giving you
easily reusable logic while only having to maintain it in one place.
When you make a change inside of a custom function, that change is
automatically in effect everywhere you have chosen to use the custom
function.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building and Using Custom Functions
<div>
1
###  
Access your custom functions from the left-hand menu.
2
###  
Click [ + Add Function ] to create a new custom function.
Give your custom function a **name**, **description**, **tags**, and
choose your Request
History settings.
You can also choose to store your custom functions inside of a folder.
If the folder already exists, just start typing the name and select it
from the auto-complete. If the folder doesn\'t exist, you can create a
new one from here.
[] When you\'re done, click [ Save
].
3
###  
Build your custom function
A custom function has three sections --- the same as an API endpoint.
###  
‚¨áÔ∏è Inputs
The inputs are anything that a function stack needs to run. For example,
a function stack that logs in a user probably needs a username or email
and a password; these would be the inputs.
###  
üîÑ Function stack
This is where all of the magic happens. All of the business logic that
is performed lives here.
As you add functions to your function stack, it will suggest next steps
based on most popular user activity.
###  
‚¨ÜÔ∏è Response
Once the function stack has done its job, it needs to know what to
return. This lives in the Response section.
4
###  
Insert your new custom function into other function stacks.
When you\'re ready to use your new custom function in other function
stacks, click
[], choose **Custom Functions** from the
panel that opens, and select your custom function.
You\'ll be able to supply data for any inputs the custom function is
expecting here.
</div>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
###  
Creating Custom Functions from Existing Function Stacks
If you have a function stack that you\'d like to convert into a custom
function, you can do so in one of the following ways.
<div>
1
###  
Convert the entire stack
Click the three dots in the upper-right corner and choose Convert To
Function
2
###  
Select individual steps to convert to a function
You can select a group of steps and click
[]to convert those steps into a custom
function.
</div>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom Function Settings
###  
From the Settings panel
Name
Purpose
Name
The name of the custom function.
Description
An internal description, just for you.
Tags
Use tags to organize objects throughout your Xano workspace and find
them later

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Custom Function Folders
You can organize your custom functions into folders for better
organization.
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    Folders are not required if you prefer not to use them. You can
    store all of your functions in folders, or use a combination of
    folders and no folders.
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    A folder requires having at least one function inside of it ---
    empty folders are not supported.
    :::
<div>
1
###  
Creating New Functions
When creating a new function, you\'ll be given the option to store it in
a folder.
Just start typing the name of the folder. If it exists, select it from
the auto-complete dropdown. If it doesn\'t exist, it will be created for
you.
2
###  
Creating New Folders with Existing Functions
Click the [ Add Folder ] button to create a new folder
for your existing functions.
Give your new folder a name, and use the autocomplete to select at least
one function to add to it.
3
###  
Moving Existing Functions into Folders
Select the functions to move by using the checkboxes on the left-hand
side, and click [ Move ]
Type a new folder name, or add them to an existing folder. When you\'re
ready, click [ Save ]
</div>
