```javascript
// Healthcare and compliance function examples
const healthcareComplianceFunctions = {
  // Patient management and HIPAA compliance
  patientManagement: {
    hipaaCompliantDataHandling: {
      prompt: "Create a HIPAA-compliant patient data management function that securely handles patient information, implements access controls, maintains audit logs, ensures data encryption, and provides privacy protection",

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Be Specific in Requirements**: Provide detailed, specific requirements for better AI-generated functions

2. **Iterate and Refine**: Use the AI assistant iteratively to refine and improve generated functions

3. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test AI-generated functions with real data and edge cases

4. **Document AI Logic**: Document the business logic behind AI-generated functions for team understanding

5. **Monitor Performance**: Monitor the performance of AI-generated functions in production environments

## Try This: Build Your First AI-Powered API

Create a comprehensive API endpoint using the AI Lambda Assistant:

```javascript
// Complete AI-powered API development example
const aiPoweredApiDevelopment = {
  // 1. Requirements definition
  requirementsDefinition: {
    businessGoal: "Create a customer management API with intelligent features",
    functionality: [
      "Customer registration with validation and duplicate detection",
      "Customer profile management with preference learning",
      "Intelligent customer segmentation based on behavior",
      "Automated communication preferences and timing optimization",
      "Customer lifetime value calculation and prediction"
    ]
  },
  
  // 2. AI assistant prompt
  aiPrompt: `Create a comprehensive customer management API that includes:
  
  - Customer registration with email validation, duplicate detection, and welcome automation
  - Profile management with intelligent preference learning and recommendation
  - Automated customer segmentation based on behavior patterns and purchase history
  - Communication preference optimization based on engagement analytics
  - Customer lifetime value calculation with predictive analytics
  
  Include proper error handling, validation, authentication, and detailed logging.
  Optimize for scalability and integrate with email marketing and analytics systems.`,
  
  // 3. Function refinement
  refinementProcess: {
    initialReview: "Review AI-generated function structure and logic",
    businessValidation: "Validate alignment with business requirements",
    securityAudit: "Review security measures and data protection",
    performanceOptimization: "Optimize for expected load and response times",
    integrationTesting: "Test integration with existing systems"
  },
  
  // 4. Production deployment
  productionDeployment: {
    testing: "Comprehensive testing with real and simulated data",
    monitoring: "Set up monitoring and alerting for function performance",
    documentation: "Create comprehensive API documentation",
    teamTraining: "Train team on AI-generated function logic and maintenance"
  }
};
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Vague or unclear requirements in AI prompts**
✅ Provide specific, detailed requirements with context and examples

❌ **Not testing AI-generated functions thoroughly**
✅ Test with real data, edge cases, and error scenarios

❌ **Using AI-generated functions without understanding the logic**
✅ Review and understand generated logic before production deployment

❌ **Not iterating on AI-generated functions**
✅ Use iterative refinement to improve function quality and performance

❌ **Ignoring security and compliance in AI-generated code**
✅ Review and enhance security measures in all AI-generated functions

The AI Lambda Assistant transforms natural language requirements into sophisticated backend functionality, enabling rapid development and intelligent automation. Use this powerful tool strategically to accelerate your development workflow while maintaining code quality and security standards.
