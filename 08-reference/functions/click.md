Background Tasks 
================
Build and run workflows on a set schedule
Quick Summary
Background tasks, or sometimes referred to as \"cron jobs\" are
workflows that run on a set schedule. Background tasks are great for
things like sending out marketing emails, report generation, analytics,
and large data processing jobs.
Background Tasks are available on our **Starter plan** and higher.
Building and Using Background Tasks
<div>
1
###  
Click
[] in the left-hand menu to access your
background tasks.
2
###  
Click
[] to create a new background task.
Fill in your desired options, such as **name**, **description**,
**tags**, **request
history**, and the preferred **data
source**.
3
###  
Build your background task.
Background tasks are a little different from APIs and custom functions,
in that they do not have inputs or deliver a response. Tasks have two
sections that require your attention.
###  
üîÑ Function stack
This is where all of the magic happens. All of the business logic that
is performed lives here.
As you add functions to your function stack, it will suggest next steps
based on most popular user activity.
####  
üìÖ Schedule
The schedule determines when your background task runs, and how often.
If a new run is scheduled to begin before the previous has completed,
the currently due run will be skipped.
4
###  
Set your task to active.
Once you have built your function stack and your task schedule, click
Enable Task to set it as active, and publish your changes.
