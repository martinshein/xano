# Release Track Preferences & Version Management

## üìã **Quick Summary**
Master Xano's release track preferences to control when and how your instances receive platform updates. Essential for enterprise environments, production stability, and coordinated deployment strategies across development teams using n8n and WeWeb integrations.

## üéØ **Core Concepts**

### Understanding Release Tracks
Release track preferences allow you to control the timing and frequency of Xano platform updates to your instances. This feature provides stability and predictability for production environments while ensuring you can access new features when ready.

**Available Release Tracks:**
- **Stable Track**: Thoroughly tested updates with maximum stability
- **Beta Track**: Early access to new features with extended testing
- **Fast Track**: Latest updates as soon as they're available
- **Custom Schedule**: Define specific update windows for your organization

### When to Use Release Track Preferences
- **Production Environments**: Maintain stability with controlled updates
- **Enterprise Deployments**: Coordinate updates across multiple instances
- **Development Workflows**: Test new features before production deployment
- **Compliance Requirements**: Ensure update processes meet regulatory standards

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuring Release Track Preferences**

### Accessing Release Track Settings
```javascript
// Navigation to release track preferences
{
  "access_method": {
    "location": "Instance Settings",
