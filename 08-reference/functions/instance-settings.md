# Instance Settings - Complete Configuration and Management Guide

## üìã **Quick Summary**

Instance Settings provide comprehensive control over your Xano backend infrastructure, including custom domain configuration, database access, plan management, security policies, and performance optimization. Master these settings to scale your applications effectively and maintain optimal performance.

## What You'll Learn

- **Custom Domain Setup**: Configure branded API endpoints with SSL/TLS certificates
- **Database Connector**: Direct PostgreSQL access for external tools and analytics
- **Plan Management**: Upgrade instances and manage billing configurations
- **Security Configuration**: Implement security policies and access controls
- **Regional Deployment**: Optimize performance with geographic server placement
- **Integration Workflows**: Connect instance settings to development and deployment pipelines

```javascript
// Infrastructure as Code approaches
const infrastructureAsCode = {
  // Configuration management
  configurationManagement: {
    declarativeConfig: {
      approach: "Define desired instance configuration",
      benefits: "Reproducible and version-controlled setup",
      tools: "Terraform, CloudFormation, or custom scripts",

## üí° **Pro Tips**

1. **Plan Upgrades Carefully**: Always plan instance upgrades during low-traffic periods and prepare rollback procedures

2. **Use Custom Domains**: Implement custom domains early to avoid URL changes during scaling

3. **Monitor Performance**: Set up comprehensive monitoring before making configuration changes

4. **Test Thoroughly**: Test all configuration changes in staging environments first

5. **Document Changes**: Maintain detailed documentation of all instance configuration changes

## Try This: Complete Instance Configuration

Set up a production-ready instance configuration:

```javascript
// Complete instance configuration checklist
const productionInstanceConfig = {
  // 1. Domain and SSL setup
  domainSetup: {
    customDomain: "Configure branded API endpoints",
    sslCertificates: "Ensure automatic SSL certificate management",
    dnsOptimization: "Optimize DNS for performance",
    monitoring: "Monitor certificate renewal and DNS health"
  },
  
  // 2. Security configuration
  securitySetup: {
    accessControl: "Configure IP allowlists and authentication policies",
    dataProtection: "Implement encryption and privacy controls",
    monitoring: "Set up security monitoring and alerting",
    compliance: "Ensure compliance with relevant regulations"
  },
  
  // 3. Performance optimization
  performanceOptimization: {
    regionSelection: "Choose optimal server region",
    resourceAllocation: "Configure appropriate plan tier",
    monitoring: "Set up performance monitoring",
    alerting: "Configure performance alerts"
  },
  
  // 4. Operational excellence
  operationalSetup: {
    backupStrategy: "Implement comprehensive backup strategy",
    monitoringDashboards: "Create operational dashboards",
    incidentResponse: "Prepare incident response procedures",
    documentation: "Document all configurations and procedures"
  }
};
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Not planning for URL changes during upgrades**
‚úÖ Plan frontend updates and use environment variables

‚ùå **Ignoring security best practices**
‚úÖ Implement comprehensive security measures from the start

‚ùå **Not testing configuration changes**
‚úÖ Test all changes in staging environments first

‚ùå **Poor backup and disaster recovery planning**
‚úÖ Implement robust backup and recovery procedures

‚ùå **Inadequate monitoring and alerting**
