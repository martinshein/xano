1.  Team Collaboration
Managing Team Members 
=====================
Xano allows you to collaborate on projects by adding a team member to your instance. Be sure to check your plan to see if additional team members are included.
###  
Add a Team Member
From the instance page, find the instance that you wish to add a team member. Click the menu icon and select **Manage Team**.
Open the Instance Admin Panel.
Select Manage Team.
Only the owner of the instance can add additional team members.
Select Add New Team Member.
**Make sure your team member has already signed up for a Xano account** (a free account is perfectly fine). Enter the email address the team member uses for their Xano account. Then choose the role of admin or developer for the team member.
###  
Team Member Roles
***Owner*** is the owner of the instance. You have full control over who has access to the instance and what roles someone will have.
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    Admin - full access to everything including the ability to manage team members.
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    Developer - full access to everything except managing team members.
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    Read-only - read-only access to everything except for actions like workspace export and run & debug.
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    Suspended - no access at all, but still a team member (this tends to be a temporary state, so you can switch back without having to re-invite the user).
    :::
***Agency*** is a special role, which gives admin rights to members of the Agency.
An email will be sent and once the team member accepts the invitation, they can log in using their own credentials and access your instance.
###  
Remove a Team Member and Update Roles
By selecting one of the team members you are able to either update their role or remove them from instance access.
Manage a team member\'s role or remove the team member.
###  
Manage an Agency
*Agency* is a special role, which is designated when you have accepted an invitation from a Xano Agency plan instance. The Agency role is designed for full-service management. Meaning any team members attached to the Agency plan instance will have admin rights to your instance.
Agency ABC has the Agency role.
###  
Remove an Agency
You can remove an Agency from your instance by clicking on the Agency under Team Membership.
Remove an Agency from accessing your Instance.
