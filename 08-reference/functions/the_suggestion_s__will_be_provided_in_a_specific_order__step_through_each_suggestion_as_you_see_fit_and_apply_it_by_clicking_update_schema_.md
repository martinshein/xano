###  
Ask it to critique your database design
The Database Assistant is designed to ensure that best practices for database design are followed. If you\'ve already built your database and just want to have it looked over, you can ask the assistant to check and make recommendations.

###  
Modify existing schema faster
The database assistant has the ability to create and delete table columns, allowing you to modify your database tables even faster.
3
###  
Create default Auto-generated APIs
When creating database tables, the Database Assistant can create default CRUD API endpoints for you.
On the Create Table step, click the dropdown to select creating CRUD API endpoints with the table.
