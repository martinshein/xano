        Ex. Variable **var\_1** has a value of 123, with a type of text.
        You set up a conditional statement to check if **var\_1 ===
        123**, but your value in the conditional statement is of type
        integer. This would return false, because the types do not
        match.

    **LIKE** - Used for comparing text. Like is case-insensitive and
    compares if a text string is like another text string. It can be

This could be a hardcoded value, a variable, or even a database field
from the same record.
