Use a Pre-built Action
Xano Actions are available for you to import directly into your workspace and enable messaging features, such as sending Slack messages.
Click on any of the Actions below to try it out and add it to your workspace.
Never used an Action before? Check out our docs here.
 **Send Slack Message**
 **Send Whatsapp Message**
In the Marketplace
In the Xano Marketplace, several messaging templates are available.
If you don\'t have the Marketplace enabled, use the steps below to enable it.
<div>
1
###  
Head to your workspace settings.
Click []in the left-hand navigation.
2
###  
Access additional settings by clicking the [‚öôÔ∏è] icon in the top-right corner, and choose Settings.
3
###  
Check the Show Marketplace option.
You should now see [] in your left-hand navigation.
</div>
Why is the Marketplace not enabled by default?
We are in the process of phasing out this version of the Marketplace in favor of Xano Actions and related features. You can still use the Marketplace, and anything you utilize there will not disappear, but please note that some Marketplace extensions may not be up to date. We\'re working hard to bring you a better experience here.
Build Your Own
You can also build your own messaging functions by using our External API Request function and following the API documentation available for your service of choice. Some popular options are linked below for your convenience.
**Facebook Messager / Instagram**
**Twilio**
