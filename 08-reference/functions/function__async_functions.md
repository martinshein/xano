    What are async functions?
-   When should I use async
    functions?
-   Insert a custom function into your function
    stack.
-   Click on the function to change the execution
    mode.
-   If necessary, retrieve the output of the async
    function.

Async Functions 
===============
Use async functions to ensure that your custom functions execute exactly
as you intend
What are async functions?
When working with custom functions in Xano, you can choose to have them
execute asynchronously. An async function works like a background
task, allowing your main process to continue without waiting
for the custom function to finish.
When should I use async functions?
Asynchronous execution can be particularly beneficial in scenarios where
you don\'t want certain tasks to hold up the entire process. For
instance, if you\'re running a complex data fetch or a time-consuming
operation, doing it asynchronously means your main application or
interface remains responsive to user inputs while the background
operation continues independently. This can enhance user experience by
reducing wait times.
Here are a few examples of when to use async functions:
-   :::

    ::: 
    **Loading Data:** When fetching data from a server, such as pulling
    in user information or loading a list of products, async functions
    allow the page to display its initial content quickly without
    waiting for the entire data request to complete.
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    **File Uploads:** Starting a file upload process without freezing
    the interface lets users continue interacting with the application
    while the file is being processed.
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    **Notification Systems:** Sending notifications through email or
    messaging services asynchronously ensures that users continue their
    tasks without interruption while the messages are sent in the
    background.
    :::
Enabling Async Execution
<div>
1
###  
Insert a custom function into your function stack.
If you haven\'t built any custom functions yet, you can review our
documentation on them
here.
2
###  
Click
[]on the function to change the execution
mode.
3
###  
If necessary, retrieve the output of the async function.
If a function is set to async, it will return an ID that represents that
execution, similar to the value shown below.
Copy
``` 
6f10cc09-d3e0-4ead-9a98-a0bc66bbe673
```
You can use the **Async Function Await** function to retrieve the output
of the function once execution completes. Just provide it with an array
of the ID(s) returned when the function runs.
