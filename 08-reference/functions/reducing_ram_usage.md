## 💡 **Pro Tips**

1. **Monitor Proactively**: Set up alerts at 75% memory usage to address issues before they impact performance

2. **Clean Variables Aggressively**: Clear large variables immediately after use in function stacks

3. **Use Pagination Everywhere**: Implement pagination for all queries that might return large result sets

4. **Optimize Lambda Usage**: Use expressions instead of Lambda functions for simple operations

5. **Cache Intelligently**: Implement TTL policies and cache invalidation strategies for all cached data

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Not monitoring memory usage proactively**
✅ Set up alerts and monitor memory trends continuously

❌ **Loading entire datasets into memory for processing**
✅ Use pagination, streaming, and chunking for large data operations

❌ **Not clearing variables after use in function stacks**
✅ Aggressively clean up variables when they're no longer needed

❌ **Using Lambda functions for simple operations**
✅ Use expressions for simple calculations and transformations

❌ **Implementing caching without TTL or eviction policies**
✅ Always implement proper cache management and cleanup

Memory optimization in Xano requires systematic attention to database queries, function design, Lambda usage, and caching strategies. Implement these optimization techniques to build scalable, efficient applications that perform reliably under any load condition.
