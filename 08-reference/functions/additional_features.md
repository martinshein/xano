## Response Caching

### Understanding Response Caching
Response caching stores API responses temporarily to reduce database load and improve performance for frequently accessed endpoints.

```javascript
// Response caching strategy framework
const responseCache = {
  // Caching benefits
  benefits: [
    "Reduced database query load",
    "Faster API response times",
    "Improved user experience",
    "Lower server resource usage",
    "Better handling of traffic spikes"
  ],
  
  // Cache key generation
  keyGeneration: {
    default: "Endpoint URL + query parameters",
    custom: "Include user context, filters, or other variables",
    examples: [
      "GET /api/products?category=electronics",
      "GET /api/users/123/profile", 
      "GET /api/search?q=laptop&sort=price"
    ]
  },
  
  // Cache invalidation strategies
  invalidation: {
    timeBasedTTL: "Expire cache after specific duration",
    eventBased: "Invalidate when underlying data changes",
    manual: "Programmatically clear cache when needed",
    versionBased: "Use version numbers to manage cache freshness"
  }
};
```

### Implementing Response Caching

**Step 1: Enable Caching in API Settings**
```javascript
// API endpoint caching configuration
const apiCachingConfig = {
  location: "API Settings panel",
  setting: "Response caching",
  
  options: {
    enabled: true,
    ttl: "Time-to-live in seconds",
    cacheKey: "Auto-generated or custom key pattern",
    conditions: "Optional conditions for when to cache"
  },
  
  // Recommended TTL values by endpoint type
  ttlRecommendations: {
    staticContent: "3600 seconds (1 hour)",
    productCatalog: "1800 seconds (30 minutes)",
    userProfiles: "300 seconds (5 minutes)", 
    realTimeData: "60 seconds (1 minute)",
    statisticsReports: "14400 seconds (4 hours)"
  }
};
```

**Step 2: Configure Cache Headers**
```javascript
// HTTP cache headers for client-side caching
const cacheHeaders = {
  // Server-side cache settings
  serverCache: {
    "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=3600",
    "ETag": "Version identifier for cache validation",
    "Last-Modified": "When the resource was last updated"
  },
  
  // Client-side cache directives
  clientDirectives: {
    public: "Can be cached by browsers and CDNs",
    private: "Only cacheable by user's browser",
    "no-cache": "Must revalidate with server before use",
    "no-store": "Never cache this response",
    "max-age": "Maximum age in seconds"
  }
};
```

**Step 3: Smart Cache Invalidation**
```javascript
// Intelligent cache invalidation patterns
const cacheInvalidation = {
  // Event-based invalidation
  databaseTriggers: {
    onProductUpdate: {
      invalidate: [
        "/api/products/*",
        "/api/categories/*", 
        "/api/search*"
      ],
      method: "Pattern-based cache clearing"
    }
  },
  
  // Manual invalidation via API
  manualInvalidation: {
    endpoint: "POST /api/cache/invalidate",
    payload: {
      patterns: ["/api/products/*"],
      keys: ["specific-cache-key"],
      all: false
    }
  },
  
  // Conditional caching
  conditionalCaching: {
    conditions: [
      "Cache only for authenticated users",
      "Skip caching during business hours",
      "Cache based on user role or permissions"
    ]
  }
};
```

### Advanced Caching Strategies

```javascript
// Multi-layer caching architecture
const multiLayerCaching = {
  // Application layer caching
  applicationLayer: {
    responseCache: "Full API response caching",
    queryCache: "Database query result caching",
    computationCache: "Expensive calculation results",
    templateCache: "Rendered template caching"
  },
  
  // Database layer caching
  databaseLayer: {
    queryPlan: "PostgreSQL query plan caching",
    resultSet: "Frequently accessed data caching",
    aggregations: "Pre-computed statistics and reports"
  },
  
  // CDN layer caching
  cdnLayer: {
    staticAssets: "Images, CSS, JavaScript files",
    apiResponses: "Cacheable API responses at edge locations",
    geoDistribution: "Location-based content caching"
  }
};
```

## Environment Variables

### Variable Management System
Environment variables provide secure, flexible configuration management across different deployment environments.

```javascript
// Environment variable architecture
const environmentVariables = {
  // Variable types and use cases
  variableTypes: {
    secrets: {
      examples: ["API_KEY", "DATABASE_PASSWORD", "JWT_SECRET"],
      security: "Never log or expose in responses",
      management: "Secure key-value storage"
    },
    
    configuration: {
      examples: ["API_BASE_URL", "CACHE_TTL", "MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE"],
      purpose: "Environment-specific settings",
      flexibility: "Easy updates without code changes"
    },
    
    featureFlags: {
      examples: ["ENABLE_NEW_FEATURE", "DEBUG_MODE", "MAINTENANCE_MODE"],
      usage: "Toggle features without deployment",
      testing: "A/B testing and gradual rollouts"
    }
  },
  
  // Environment separation
  environments: {
    development: {
      debugging: "Verbose logging and debug information",
      apis: "Development API endpoints and test keys",
      database: "Development database connections"
    },
    
    staging: {
      testing: "Production-like environment for QA",
      apis: "Staging API endpoints and test data",
      performance: "Performance testing configurations"
    },
    
    production: {
      optimization: "Production-optimized settings",
      security: "Production API keys and certificates",
      monitoring: "Enhanced logging and alerting"
    }
  }
};
```

### Environment Variable Best Practices

```javascript
// Secure variable management patterns
const variableManagement = {
  // Naming conventions
  namingConventions: {
    pattern: "ENVIRONMENT_CATEGORY_VARIABLE_NAME",
    examples: [
      "PROD_DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING",
      "DEV_API_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY",
      "STAGING_CACHE_REDIS_URL"
    ],
    consistency: "Use consistent naming across all environments"
  },
  
  // Security practices
  securityPractices: {
    rotation: {
      frequency: "Regular rotation of sensitive keys",
      automation: "Automated key rotation where possible",
