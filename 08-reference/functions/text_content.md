1.  Before You
    Begin
Using These Docs 
================
Throughout this documentation, we will be focusing on building a
complete backend as an example. As you progress, you\'ll be able to
follow along and build with us.
Before you dive in, let\'s check out some of the ways you\'ll learn
about Xano using these docs.
###  
Text Content
The bread and butter of our documentation; we have a ton of content here
for you to read and follow along with in product.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
###  
Quick Summary / Definitions
Review quick definitions and summaries of the documentation you\'re
viewing, and keep scrolling if you wish for the full version.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
###  
Videos
<div>
</div>
A majority of our functions, features, and use cases have accompanying
video content which you can review right alongside our documentation, or
save for later viewing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
###  
Interactive Demos
We\'ve included interactive demos that allow you to get a feel for the
experience you\'re reading about without leaving the documentation at
all. Try the one above to see how it works!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
###  
Actions
If you see this image anywhere, that means there is a Xano Action
available for that piece of documentation. For example, if we are
walking you through how to build a multi-step function, we might provide
an Action alongside it that you can review, interact with, and even
import into your Xano account to use right away.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
###  
Build Along Examples
[üìö] **Build-along Example: Online Bookstore**
Nice job! Look out for these in the documentation so you can build along
with us!
If you see the above in any piece of our documentation, it means that
there is another opportunity for you to try out that function or feature
yourself by building or iterating on the Online Bookstore example. Just
click the \> icon to expand the content.
It\'s recommended that you create a new workspace to contain this sample
project if you\'d like to follow along. Check out the interactive demo
below to see how to create a new workspace. For users on our free plan,
you can use your existing workspace.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
###  
Annotations
Every now and then, we might mention a term that, if you\'re following
the documentation in order, you might not have heard yet. We don\'t want
to take a hard left turn and bring you to a full lesson yet, but you can
click on any term that[ ][looks like
this][ ]to get a quick bit of more
information or context.
