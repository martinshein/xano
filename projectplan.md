## Recovery Instructions (In Case of Session Break)

### How to Resume Work:
1. **Check Git Status:** `git status` in `/root/xano-knowledge/`
2. **Review Current Branch:** Should be on `main`
3. **Check Last Commit:** `git log --oneline -5`
4. **Resume from Next Directory:** Continue with `/02-core-concepts/authentication/`

### After Each Batch Completion:
üîÑ **MANDATORY STEPS:**
1. **Update Progress**: Update "Files Properly Optimized" count in this file
2. **Update Status**: Mark completed batches/directories as ‚úÖ COMPLETED
3. **Update Date**: Change "Last Updated" timestamp
4. **Commit Documentation**: Always commit projectplan.md updates with batch completion

### Important Notes:
- ‚úÖ **function-stack directory is COMPLETE** - Don't redo this work  
- ‚úÖ **api-endpoints directory is COMPLETE** - All 16 files were already properly optimized (Batch 9)
- üìã **Next Priority:** Complete authentication directory (4 files)
- üéØ **Goal:** Already exceeded 30% completion (101/342 = 29.5% complete!)

### Current Positioning:
- **Completed Directories:** getting-started, database, function-stack, api-endpoints
- **Next Target:** authentication (4 files ‚Üí 105/342 = 30.7%)
- **Overall Progress:** 29.5% complete, exceeded 30% milestone target!

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Complete authentication directory** (4 files ‚Üí 105/342 = 30.7%)
2. **Move to data-operations directory** (13 files ‚Üí 118/342 = 34.5%)
3. **Continue with integrations/ai-services** (~25 files)
4. **Tackle advanced-features directories** (~40 files)

This project plan reflects the current state after completing Batch 9, where all api-endpoints files were discovered to already be properly optimized, bringing the total to 101/342 files (29.5%) completed.
