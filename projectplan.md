## Recovery Instructions (In Case of Session Break)

### How to Resume Work:
1. **Check Git Status:** `git status` in `/root/xano-knowledge/`
2. **Review Current Branch:** Should be on `main`
3. **Check Last Commit:** `git log --oneline -5`
4. **Resume from Next Directory:** Continue with `/02-core-concepts/authentication/`

### After Each Batch Completion:
üîÑ **MANDATORY STEPS:**
1. **Update Progress**: Update "Files Properly Optimized" count in this file
2. **Update Status**: Mark completed batches/directories as ‚úÖ COMPLETED
3. **Update Date**: Change "Last Updated" timestamp
4. **Commit Documentation**: Always commit projectplan.md updates with batch completion

### Important Notes:
- ‚úÖ **function-stack directory is COMPLETE** - 79/79 complete (100%) üéâ
- ‚úÖ **api-endpoints directory is COMPLETE** - All 16 files were already properly optimized (Batch 9)
- ‚úÖ **authentication directory is COMPLETE** - All 4 files were already properly optimized (Current Session Discovery)
- üéâ **MAJOR MILESTONE:** 30% threshold EXCEEDED - 105/342 files (30.7%) complete
- üìã **Next Priority:** Start data-operations directory (13 files ‚Üí 34.5%)
- üéØ **Current Status:** 105/342 files (30.7%) completed - 30% MILESTONE ACHIEVED!

### Current Positioning:
- **Completed Directories:** getting-started, database, function-stack, api-endpoints, authentication (5 directories done)
- **Next Target:** data-operations directory (13 files ‚Üí 118/342 = 34.5%)
- **Overall Progress:** 30.7% complete, 30% milestone ACHIEVED! üéâ

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Start data-operations directory** (13 files ‚Üí 118/342 = 34.5%)
2. **Continue with integrations** (~25 files ‚Üí ~143/342 = 41.8%)
3. **Tackle advanced-features directories** (~40 files)
4. **Complete reference directories** (~125+ files)

This project plan reflects the current state after discovering the authentication directory was already complete - achieving the 30% milestone with 105/342 files (30.7%) optimized across 5 completed directories.
