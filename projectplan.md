## Recovery Instructions (In Case of Session Break)

### How to Resume Work:
1. **Check Git Status:** `git status` in `/root/xano-knowledge/`
2. **Review Current Branch:** Should be on `main`
3. **Check Last Commit:** `git log --oneline -5`
4. **Resume from Next Directory:** Continue with `/02-core-concepts/authentication/`

### After Each Batch Completion:
üîÑ **MANDATORY STEPS:**
1. **Update Progress**: Update "Files Properly Optimized" count in this file
2. **Update Status**: Mark completed batches/directories as ‚úÖ COMPLETED
3. **Update Date**: Change "Last Updated" timestamp
4. **Commit Documentation**: Always commit projectplan.md updates with batch completion

### Important Notes:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **function-stack directory needs 16 more files** - 63/79 complete (79.7%)
- ‚úÖ **api-endpoints directory is COMPLETE** - All 16 files were already properly optimized (Batch 9)
- üìã **Next Priority:** Complete remaining function-stack files (16 files) OR start authentication
- üéØ **Current Status:** 85/342 files (24.9%) completed

### Current Positioning:
- **Completed Directories:** getting-started, database, api-endpoints
- **Partially Complete:** function-stack (63/79 done, 16 remaining)
- **Next Options:** 
  - Complete function-stack (16 files ‚Üí 101/342 = 29.5%)
  - OR start authentication (4 files ‚Üí 89/342 = 26%)
- **Overall Progress:** 24.9% complete, targeting 30% milestone

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **CHOICE A: Complete function-stack remaining 16 files** (get to 101/342 = 29.5%)
2. **CHOICE B: Start authentication directory** (4 files ‚Üí 89/342 = 26%)  
3. **After function-stack completion: authentication** (4 files ‚Üí 105/342 = 30.7%)
4. **Then data-operations directory** (13 files ‚Üí 118/342 = 34.5%)

This project plan reflects the corrected state after Batch 9 assessment revealed that function-stack was not actually complete - 16 files still need optimization.
