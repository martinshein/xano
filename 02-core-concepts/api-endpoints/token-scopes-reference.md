# Metadata API Token Scopes Reference

## üìã **Quick Summary**

**What it does:** Token scopes control precisely what permissions a Metadata API access token has across your Xano workspace, enabling secure, granular access control for external integrations.

**Why it matters:** Proper scope configuration:
- Protects your data with least-privilege access
- Prevents security breaches from over-permissioned tokens
- Enables secure third-party integrations
- Ensures compliance with security best practices

**Time to implement:** 5-10 minutes to configure, critical for security

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding the principle of least privilege
- Complete scope reference with permissions (CRUD)
- Security best practices for token management
- Common scope configurations for popular tools
- Real-world access control scenarios
- Token lifecycle management strategies

## Understanding Token Scopes

Think of token scopes like giving someone keys to specific rooms in your house - you want to give access only to the areas they need, not the master key to everything.

### üéØ **Core Security Principles:**
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal permissions necessary
- **Scope Isolation**: Separate concerns by limiting access
- **Time-Limited Access**: Rotate tokens regularly
- **Audit Trail**: Monitor token usage and access patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Security Warning**

**Metadata API tokens grant access to ALL workspaces in your instance.**

This means:
- A single token can access multiple workspaces
- Scope permissions apply across all accessible workspaces
- Extra caution is required for multi-workspace instances
- Consider separate instances for different security contexts

## CRUD Permissions Explained

Each scope supports four permission levels:

| Permission | Symbol | Description | Security Impact |
|------------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Create** | C | Add new data | Can create records, files, schemas |
| **Read** | R | View existing data | Can access sensitive information |
| **Update** | U | Modify existing data | Can alter existing records |
| **Delete** | D | Remove data | Can permanently destroy data |

### üí° **Permission Strategy**

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Token Lifecycle Management

Token Rotation Schedule:
- Development tokens: Monthly
- Production tokens: Quarterly
- Admin tokens: Bi-annually
- Integration tokens: Per vendor requirements
```

### 2. Environment Separation

```yaml
Development Environment:
- Broader permissions acceptable
- Frequent token rotation
- Logging and monitoring

Staging Environment:
- Production-like restrictions
- Limited token distribution
- Testing security policies

Production Environment:
- Strict least-privilege
- Minimal token count
- Comprehensive audit logging
```

### 3. Access Control Matrix

| Integration Type | Database | Content | Files | API Groups | Tasks | History |
|------------------|----------|---------|-------|------------|-------|---------|
| **Analytics Dashboard** | R | R | - | R | - | R |
| **Data Import Tool** | C, R | R | C, R | R | - | - |
| **Admin Panel** | C, R, U, D | R, U | C, R, U, D | R, U | C, R | R |
| **Monitoring System** | R | R | - | R | R | R |
| **Backup Solution** | R | R | R | R | R | R |

### 4. Token Audit Checklist

```yaml
Regular Reviews:
- [ ] List all active tokens
- [ ] Verify each token's purpose
- [ ] Check last usage dates
- [ ] Review assigned permissions
- [ ] Validate integration needs
- [ ] Remove unused tokens
- [ ] Document token purposes
```

### 5. Security Monitoring

```javascript
// Token usage monitoring pattern
const tokenAudit = {
  trackUsage: (tokenId, endpoint, action) => {
    // Log token usage
    console.log(`Token ${tokenId} accessed ${endpoint} with ${action}`);
  },
  
  detectAnomalies: (tokenId, usagePattern) => {
    // Flag unusual usage patterns
    if (usagePattern.frequencySpike > threshold) {
      alert(`Unusual activity detected for token ${tokenId}`);
    }
  },
  
  enforceRateLimit: (tokenId, requestCount, timeWindow) => {
    // Implement rate limiting per token
    if (requestCount > maxRequestsPerHour) {
      blockToken(tokenId, timeWindow);
    }
  }
};
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Token Compromise Response

```yaml
Immediate Actions:
1. Revoke compromised token immediately
2. Generate new token with minimal required scopes
3. Update integration configurations
4. Review access logs for unauthorized activity
5. Document incident for security review

Investigation Steps:
1. Identify scope of potential data access
2. Check for unauthorized data modifications
3. Review related token usage patterns
4. Assess impact on connected systems
5. Implement additional security measures
```

### Recovery Procedures

```yaml
Service Restoration:
1. Create emergency read-only token
2. Test critical integrations
3. Gradually restore full permissions
4. Monitor for unusual activity
5. Complete security assessment

Documentation Updates:
1. Update token inventory
2. Revise security procedures
3. Train team on new protocols
4. Schedule security review
```

## üí° **Try This**

### Beginner Exercise
Create tokens for different scenarios:
1. Read-only analytics token
2. Data entry form token
3. File upload service token

### Intermediate Challenge
Design a scope matrix for:
1. Multi-tenant SaaS application
2. Agency managing client workspaces
3. Enterprise with multiple departments

### Advanced Project
Implement automated token management:
1. Token rotation system
2. Usage monitoring dashboard
3. Security compliance reporting

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-permissioning tokens** - Granting excessive permissions "just in case"
2. **Never rotating tokens** - Using the same tokens indefinitely
3. **Ignoring unused tokens** - Leaving old tokens active without purpose
4. **No usage monitoring** - Missing security incidents and abuse
5. **Shared tokens** - Using one token across multiple integrations

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy Regulations

```yaml
GDPR Compliance:
- Document data access purposes
- Implement data minimization
- Enable data deletion capabilities
- Maintain audit trails

CCPA Compliance:
- Track data access requests
- Enable consumer data exports
- Support data deletion requests
- Maintain transparency logs
```

### Industry Standards

```yaml
SOC 2 Compliance:
- Regular access reviews
- Privileged access management
- Security monitoring
- Incident response procedures

ISO 27001:
- Access control policies
- Risk assessment procedures
- Security awareness training
- Management reviews
```
