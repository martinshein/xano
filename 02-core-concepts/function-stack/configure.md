Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a robust search engine designed for quick and efficient data retrieval in applications. It handles diverse data types, employs a distributed architecture, and offers a powerful query language for real-time search needs. Integration into your applications enhances search experiences, enabling developers to implement efficient full-text searches and complex queries. Elasticsearch\'s indexing capabilities make it valuable for applications such as monitoring systems, log analysis tools, and other scenarios requiring fast and relevant data access.
**Below is a video for our OpenSearch functionality, which can be used as a reference when working with our Elasticsearch functions; they are largely the same.**

Elasticsearch Query Wizard Function
Use the query wizard to easily search documents stored in Elasticsearch.
###  
Configure
See Connect to Elasticsearch for details on configuration.
Then, select a `return_type` from the options below.
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    `search` - Returns records that match query
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    `count` - Returns number of total records matching query
    :::
###  
Query
**Query Wizard**
Set filter criteria using the Xano query builder. The left input is the field to filter on. Then set the operator and value to evaluate. Optionally, add multiple conditions using AND / OR logic.
Select 'Update Payload' to ensure your changes are reflected in the query payload.
**Output Options**
These options can only be set on 'search' return type (not 'count').
Size: the number of results to return (useful for pagination)
From: the number to offset the results (useful for pagination)
Included Fields: field names to include in the results. Can be formatted as JSON array or comma separated string.
Sort: order to return results. Default is by Elasticsearch relevance score. Option to choose one or more fields to sort in ascending or descending order.
**Payload (auto-generated)**
The JSON sent as the payload to Elasticsearch. This is generated by the Query Wizard and Output Options sections. Useful for debugging.
Dynamic values (variables, inputs, etc.) are escaped using parentheses and use Xano expression syntax. These will be evaluated at the time of the request.
Changes made directly to the payload may be overwritten by other areas of the query wizard. If you already have a query payload you want to use, it is recommended to use the Elasticsearch Request function instead.

<div>
</div>
####  
Google Service Account
You need to set up a Google Service Account in the Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to IAM & Admin and select Service Accounts.
Select **+ Create Service Account.**
####  
Roles
**Be sure to include the following Roles for the Service Account**:
-   ::: 
    :::

    `Storage Admin`
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    `Storage Object Admin`
    :::
Once the Service Account is created, select actions and **Manage keys.**
Then add a new key and select the JSON option.
Google will provide a JSON file for download. Open the file and copy the JSON key. Paste this into your Xano workspace either as an Environment Variable or as a variable in the function stack that you are using the Google Cloud Storage functions.
The JSON key must be entered as a **text string**. Do not import the key as JSON when adding it to Xano.
###  
List Directory
List the contents of a Google Cloud Storage Bucket.
**Service Account** - the JSON key, stored as text, from your Google Service Account
**Bucket** - the name of the Bucket you wish to access.
**Path** - the path you wish to see the contents of.
###  
Signed URL
Generate a signed URL to provide limited permissions. These can be used with a TTL (time to live) similar to an expiring token.
**Service Account** - the JSON key, stored as text, from your Google Service Account
**Bucket** - the name of the Bucket you wish to access.
**filePath** - the path of the file you wish to generate the URL for.
**Method** - the HTTP method (GET or POST)
**TTL** - time to live, in seconds. (How long until the URL expires).
###  
Upload a File
Upload a File to the specific Google Cloud Storage bucket.
**Service Account** - the JSON key, stored as text, from your Google Service Account
**Bucket** - the name of the Bucket you upload a file to.
**filePath** - the path and name of the file you wish to store in the bucket. For example \"files/image1\" will upload the image in the files folder and name it image1.
**File** - the file being uploaded. This should come from a file resource input or a file resource variable.
###  
Delete File
Delete a specific file from a Bucket.
**Service Account** - the JSON key, stored as text, from your Google Service Account
**Bucket** - the name of the Bucket that contains the file.
**filePath** - the path of the file you wish to delete from the Bucket.
###  
Create Variable From File Resource
Return the file resource as a variable in Xano, including the raw image. This can be used, for example, to send to another service if file transfer is needed.
**Service Account** - the JSON key, stored as text, from your Google Service Account
**Bucket** - the name of the Bucket that contains the file.
**filePath** - the path of the file you wish to create a variable of.
####  
Example - Using the Variable Created from File Resource
Turn your API endpoint into a redirect to the file by returning the data field from the return variable and setting a custom header of Content-Type with the mime of the file resource.
Here\'s an example return of Create Variable from File Resource:
If we return the raw image (data) and use a Set Header function to define `Content-Type` the mime (in this example `image/png`). We can have our endpoint URL redirect to the file.
Amazon S3
###  
Access Key and Secret Access Key
From your AWS Developer Console, navigate to **Security Credentials**.
Scroll down to **Access Keys** and select **Create access key** unless you have an access key and secret already generated.
Select **Command Line Interface (CLI)** as the use case and choose next, optionally add a description, then create the access key.
