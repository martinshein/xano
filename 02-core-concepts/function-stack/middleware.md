# Middleware Functions

## Quick Summary
Middleware functions in Xano allow you to implement cross-cutting concerns that run before or after your main API logic. Essential for authentication, logging, validation, rate limiting, and other shared functionality across your endpoints.

## What You'll Learn
- Understanding middleware concepts and execution order
- Implementing authentication and authorization middleware
- Creating validation and logging middleware
- Best practices for middleware architecture

## What is Middleware?

Middleware functions are reusable pieces of logic that execute in a specific order within your API request lifecycle. They can:
- **Intercept requests** before they reach your main logic
- **Process responses** before they're sent to clients
- **Implement shared functionality** across multiple endpoints
- **Handle errors** and validation consistently

## Common Middleware Types

### Authentication Middleware
- Verify user tokens and sessions
- Extract user information from requests
- Implement role-based access control
- Handle authentication errors

### Validation Middleware
- Validate request parameters and body data
- Sanitize user inputs
- Check required fields
- Implement business rule validation

### Logging Middleware
- Log API requests and responses
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor security events
- Generate audit trails

### Security Middleware
- Implement rate limiting
- Check IP restrictions
- Validate CORS headers
- Prevent common attacks

## Try This: Build Authentication Middleware

Create middleware that:
1. Checks for valid authentication token
2. Extracts user information
3. Validates user permissions
4. Passes user data to main function
5. Handles authentication errors gracefully

This provides consistent security across all your protected endpoints.

## Integration Patterns

### For n8n
Use middleware to validate webhook signatures and format data consistently before processing in your n8n workflows.

### For WeWeb
Implement middleware that provides user context and permissions data that your WeWeb frontend can rely on.

## Execution Order

Middleware executes in a specific sequence:
1. **Request Middleware** - Runs before main logic
2. **Main Function Logic** - Your core API functionality  
3. **Response Middleware** - Runs after main logic
4. **Error Middleware** - Handles any errors that occur

## Common Use Cases
- **User Authentication** - Verify identity across all protected routes
- **Request Validation** - Ensure data integrity and security
- **API Logging** - Track usage and performance
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevent API abuse
- **Error Handling** - Consistent error responses

Middleware provides the foundation for robust, secure, and maintainable API architectures in Xano.
