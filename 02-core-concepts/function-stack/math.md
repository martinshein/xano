NOTE

When a filter below refers to the **parent value**, we\'re talking about the value box that lives immediately above the filter.

abs

Returns the absolute value

The abs filter is useful when you need the magnitude of a value regardless of its sign. For example, when calculating distances between two points or finding the difference between two values without caring about direction.

Inputs:

-   
    
        
    
    primary value: The number to get the absolute value of
    

Input

Output

-5

acos

Calculates the arc cosine of the supplied value in radians

The acos filter is useful when working with trigonometric calculations, such as determining angles in navigation systems, game development for character movement, or calculating positions in geometric applications.

Inputs:

-   
    
        
    
    primary value: A number between -1 and 1 representing a cosine value

acosh

Calculates the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the supplied value in radians

The acosh filter is useful in advanced mathematical modeling, such as in engineering calculations, physics simulations, or specialized scientific applications where hyperbolic functions are needed.

Inputs:

-   
    
        
    
    primary value: A number greater than or equal to 1
    

Input

Output

add

Add 2 values together and return the answer

The add filter is useful for combining numeric values, such as calculating a total price from multiple items, combining measurements, or incrementing counters in your application.

Inputs:

-   
    
        
    
    primary value: The first number in the addition
    
-   
    
        
    
    value: The second number to add to the primary value
    

Input

Output

5, 3

array\_max

Returns the max of the values of the array

The array\_max filter is helpful when you need to find the highest value in a collection of numbers, such as determining the highest score, finding the maximum temperature in a data set, or identifying peak values in any numerical array.

Inputs:

-   
    
        
    
    primary value: An array of numbers
    

Input

Output

\[1, 5, 3, 9, 2\]

\[-10, -5, -20\]

-5

\[3.14, 2.71, 9.81\]

9.81

 

array\_min

Returns the min of the values of the array

The array\_min filter is valuable when you need to find the lowest value in a collection of numbers, such as determining the lowest price, finding the minimum temperature in a data set, or identifying the smallest entry in any numerical array.

Inputs:

-   
    
        
    
    primary value: An array of numbers
    

Input

Output

\[1, 5, 3, 9, 2\]

1

\[-10, -5, -20\]

-20

\[3.14, 2.71, 9.81\]

2.71

 

asin

Calculates the arc sine of the supplied value in radians

The asin filter is useful in trigonometric applications, such as calculating angles in physics simulations, determining trajectories in navigation, or solving geometric problems that involve angles.

Inputs:

-   
    
        
    
    primary value: A number between -1 and 1 representing a sine value
