    :::
    ::: 
    **IV** - This is either 16 or 12 characters depending on your algorithm (cbc requires 16 characters and gcm requires 12). This information should be kept hidden in an env variable. If you are sending encrypted data to someone, then they would need to know this.
    :::
Tip: For certain use cases when passing the encrypted value through a URL, it is recommended to use the `base64_encode_urlsafe `filter.
###  
Decrypt
Decrypt a payload to its original form.

Examples
####  
JWS Encode/Decode Example
**Using your own key**
We can use our own encryption key when encoding and decoding JWS.
First, use the Create Secret Key function to generate a secret key.
[]
It\'s a good idea to store the key in a safe, reusable place such as in an environment variable. Click the copy result button on the result of the secret key.
[]
Navigate to the settings page and add your secret key as an environment variable.
[]
Next, use the JWS Encode function to encrypt a payload. In this example, we will encrypt a simple text string.
Be sure to use the secret key stored in the environment variable as the key.
Optionally add a ttl or time to live if you want the token to expire.
[]
The result is an encrypted JWS token.
[]
To decode the JWS token, we must make sure to use the same key used for encrypting it.
[]
The result is our decrypted message.
[]
###  
**Using an external key**
Sometimes you may be using a service that requires you to decode or decrypt a JWS token. Like the above example, it is recommended that you store the key in an environment variable for safe keeping and so that you may call it wherever you may need it in your workspace.
[]
When decoding the JWS from the external source, be sure to use the environment variable as the decryption key.
[]
Ensure the algorithm matches what\'s defined from the external source.
Time drift helps account for a leeway if clocks are not aligned. Consider a time drift if there is an expiration on the JWS.
####  
JWE vs JWS
The main difference between JWE and JWS is one is able to be seen but not tampered with and the other is encrypted and not tampered with. JWS is able to be seen (with the right decryption) but not tampered. JWE is encrypted and not tampered with.
**Example using JWT.IO**
We can use jwt.io to see an example of the difference between JWE and JWS.
First let\'s encode a JWE token.
[]
When we place the resulting JWE token into jwt.io, we can see that the result is an encrypted payload.
[]
Next, let\'s generate a JWS token in Xano.
[]
When we place the resulting JWS token in jwt.io and match up the correct algorithm, we are able to see the payload.
