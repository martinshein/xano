# Objects Manipulation

## Quick Summary
Objects manipulation in Xano provides advanced techniques for working with complex nested data structures, transforming object properties, and building sophisticated data processing workflows.

## What You'll Learn
- Advanced object manipulation techniques
- Merging and transforming complex objects
- Working with nested object structures
- Object validation and sanitization patterns

## Object Manipulation Operations

### Core Operations
- **Object Merge** - Combine multiple objects intelligently
- **Object Pick** - Extract specific properties
- **Object Omit** - Remove unwanted properties
- **Object Transform** - Restructure object schemas
- **Deep Copy** - Create independent object copies

### Advanced Patterns
- **Nested Property Access** - Safe navigation of deep objects
- **Conditional Object Building** - Dynamic object construction
- **Object Validation** - Schema and type checking
- **Property Mapping** - Transform keys and values

## Try This: User Profile Merger

Build a function that:
1. Merges user profile from multiple sources
2. Handles conflicting data intelligently
3. Validates final object structure
4. Returns clean, complete profile

Perfect for integrating data from social logins and user preferences.

## Integration Examples

### For n8n
Transform complex API responses into clean objects before processing in n8n workflows.

### For WeWeb
Prepare nested object data in the exact format your WeWeb components expect.

Objects manipulation enables sophisticated data processing for complex application requirements.
