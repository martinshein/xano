# APIs in Xano

**Quick Summary**
APIs in Xano are like digital waiters in a restaurant - they take requests from your frontend (like WeWeb or mobile apps), process them through your business logic, and deliver exactly what was requested. Xano makes building these APIs visual and intuitive, no coding required.

## What You'll Learn

- How APIs work as messengers between applications
- Building CRUD operations with auto-generation
- Setting up authentication and security
- Managing CORS for web applications
- Best practices for API design

## Understanding APIs

Think of an API as a bridge between your frontend application and your backend data. When someone clicks "Buy Now" on your website, an API handles that request behind the scenes.

### API Components Explained

**1. Headers**
Configuration information that travels with your request - like showing ID at a store.

**2. Method (HTTP Verb)**
Tells the API what kind of action to perform:
- **GET** ‚Üí Retrieve data (like viewing a product)
- **POST** ‚Üí Send new data (like creating an account)  
- **PUT/PATCH** ‚Üí Update existing data (like editing profile)
- **DELETE** ‚Üí Remove data (like deleting a post)

**3. Query Parameters & Request Body**
- **Query Parameters**: Data sent in the URL (`?user_id=123`)
- **Request Body**: Data sent as JSON for complex information

**4. Response**
What the API sends back - could be user data, confirmation messages, or error information.

## Auto-Generated APIs

Xano can automatically create complete API endpoints based on your database tables. Perfect for rapid development!

### CRUD Operations
**C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete - the four basic operations every app needs.

**Available Auto-Generated APIs:**
- **Query All Records** - Get a list of items (with filtering and pagination)
- **Get Single Record** - Retrieve one specific item
- **Add Record** - Create new items
- **Edit Record** - Update complete items
- **Patch Record** - Update specific fields only
- **Delete Record** - Remove items

### Authentication APIs
Pre-built endpoints for user management:
- **Sign Up** - Register new users
- **Login** - Authenticate existing users
- **Logout** - End user sessions
- **Me** - Get current user info

### File Storage APIs
Ready-made endpoints for file handling:
- **Upload File** - Accept file uploads
- **Get File** - Retrieve stored files

## Try This: Build a Blog API in 5 Minutes

**Scenario:** Create a complete blog API with posts and authors.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Database Tables
1. **Authors Table**: id, name, email, bio
2. **Posts Table**: id, title, content, author_id, published_at

### Step 2: Generate CRUD APIs
1. Go to API Groups in Xano
2. Click "Add API Endpoint"
3. Choose "CRUD Database Operations"
4. Select your Posts table
5. Generate all operations (Query, Get, Add, Edit, Patch, Delete)
6. Repeat for Authors table

### Step 3: Test Your APIs
Your blog API is ready! You now have:
- `GET /posts` - List all blog posts
- `GET /posts/{post_id}` - Get single post
- `POST /posts` - Create new post
- `PATCH /posts/{post_id}` - Update post
- `DELETE /posts/{post_id}` - Delete post

Plus the same operations for authors!

## API Groups & Organization

### API Group Settings

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Name** | Organize related endpoints together |
| **Description** | Internal notes about the API group |
| **Tags** | Label for searching across workspace |
| **Swagger** | Control API documentation access |
| **Request History** | Configure logging preferences |
| **External Access** | Enable/disable public API access |

### CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

CORS is like a security guard that controls which websites can talk to your API.

**CORS Options:**
- **Default** - Allow all origins (good for development)
- **Custom** - Specify exactly which domains can access your API

**Custom CORS Settings:**
- **Allow Credentials** - Let requests include cookies/auth tokens
- **Allow Methods** - Which HTTP methods are permitted
- **Allow Origins** - Which domains can make requests
- **Allow Headers** - Which request headers are accepted
- **Max Age** - How long browsers cache CORS settings (default: 1 hour)

---

## API Configuration Options

### Individual API Settings

| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Name** | The endpoint path and identifier |
| **Description** | Internal documentation |
| **Verb** | HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) |
| **Tags** | Organization and search labels |
| **Request History** | Logging preferences for this endpoint |
| **External Access** | Public availability toggle |
| **Authentication** | Require valid auth token |
| **Response Type** | Standard or Streaming |
| **Response Caching** | Cache responses for faster delivery |

### Response Types

**Standard Response**
- Waits for all processing to complete
- Returns complete response at once
- Best for most use cases

**Streaming Response**
- Sends data in chunks as it's processed
- Perfect for AI responses or large data processing
- Requires compatible frontend handling

## Integration Patterns for Visual Developers

### WeWeb Integration
```javascript
// WeWeb workflow calling your Xano API
1. User clicks "Load Posts" button
2. WeWeb makes GET request to your /posts endpoint
3. Xano returns posts array
4. WeWeb displays posts in repeater component
```

### n8n Automation
```javascript
// n8n workflow with Xano APIs
1. Trigger: New form submission webhook
2. Action: POST to Xano /users endpoint 
3. Action: GET from Xano /templates endpoint
4. Action: Send welcome email with template
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Making everything public**
- Use authentication for sensitive operations

‚ùå **Not setting up CORS properly**
- Your web apps won't be able to connect

‚ùå **Creating APIs for every tiny operation**
- Group related functionality together

‚ùå **Ignoring API naming conventions**
- Use clear, consistent endpoint names

‚ùå **Not testing with real data**
- Always test with realistic datasets

---

## Pro Tips

üí° **API Design Best Practices**
- Use nouns for endpoints (`/users`, not `/getUsers`)
- Be consistent with naming conventions
- Version your APIs for future changes

üí° **Security First**
- Always require authentication for write operations
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting for public APIs

üí° **Performance Optimization**
- Enable response caching for frequently accessed data
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Index database fields used in API filters

üí° **Documentation Strategy**
- Enable Swagger documentation for external developers
- Use clear descriptions for all endpoints
- Provide example requests and responses

## Real-World API Examples

### E-commerce Store APIs
```
GET /products - Browse products
GET /products/{id} - Product details  
POST /cart/items - Add to cart
GET /orders - Order history
POST /checkout - Process purchase
```

### Social Media Platform APIs
```
GET /posts - Timeline feed
POST /posts - Create new post
GET /users/{id}/profile - User profiles
POST /follow - Follow users
GET /notifications - Activity feed
```

### Project Management APIs  
```
GET /projects - List projects
POST /projects - Create project
GET /tasks - List tasks
PATCH /tasks/{id} - Update task status
POST /comments - Add task comments
```

## Advanced Features

### Database Views Integration
Connect APIs directly to database views for complex queries without custom functions.

### Middleware Integration  
Add authentication, logging, or validation layers that run before/after your APIs.

### Background Task Triggers
APIs can trigger background tasks for heavy processing or scheduled operations.
