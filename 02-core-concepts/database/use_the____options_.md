     What are Database Views?

Database Views 
==============
Database Views are used to save filtering, sorting, and search options in your tables so that you can quickly return later.
[‚ùì] What are Database Views?
In your database, you can search, filter, and sort your records to view exactly the data you\'re looking for. Database Views allow you to save those settings in a view for easy access or sharing.
[üì∑] Using Database Views
<div>
1
###  
Use the [] options.
Search, filter, sort, and/or hide fields to get exactly the view you want.
2
###  
Once you\'re ready, click the [] button.
Give your view a name and, if desired, an alias.
Take note of how the button in the control bar has changed. You\'ll now see the name of your view.
3
###  
Click the View button again to see a list of your views and switch between them.
</div>
Some complex data types, like filtering by arrays, is not currently possible. If you\'re trying to filter something and not receiving the expected results, please reach out to support or use a function stack instead.
