Schema Versioning 
=================
<div>
</div>
You can leverage versioning to help you solve problems, see differences in your work, test ideas, and easily revert back to previous versions. It also tracks who from your team made a change, and when the change was made.
Schema versioning is for database tables, API groups, API endpoints, functions, Addons, and background tasks. It allows you to easily roll back to a previous version in case you make a mistake.
Schema Versioning is available on our **Starter** plan and higher.
**How to open schema version history**
Open Version History by selecting Versions from the menu icon.
View your active (current) version, select from a previous one to roll-back, and see who made a change and when.
Version History captures which is your active version, a history of previous versions with data on when the change was made and by who, and the ability to select a previous one.
Version history will keep track of changes you make anywhere on a query, whether you make a change to a function or a filter. For API endpoints and functions, version history keeps a count of how many inputs, functions, and results were included in each version.
Counts of each versions\' inputs, functions, and results allow you to determine which version you may wish to roll-back to.
Tasks will show how many functions and schedules there were for each version.
Version history of a background task.
Addons will show a count of how many inputs each version had.
Version history of an Addon.
Compare Differences
When selecting a previous version, you can view a screenshot of the version and the differences compared to the active version. This gives you full context of the different versions to see exactly what changes were made and whether or not you indeed want to revert to the previous version.
###  
APIs
For example, here is the live version of an API endpoint:
Example of a live version of a function stack.
After selecting Version History, we can see the different versions with some metadata and publish notes about each:
The available versions of the API endpoint.
By clicking on a version, in this example we selected version \#2, a modal opens showing the differences present in the current live version \#4 as compared to the state of version \#2.
The difference comparison tells us a few things.

    The live version (indicated at the top) and when it was created.

    The email of who created the version.

Lastly, you can easily navigate through the screenshots of the different old versions.

###  
Database
Difference comparison in schema versioning is also available on the database. In addition to information about the version number, created at time, and creator. Difference comparison on the database will include differences in:
