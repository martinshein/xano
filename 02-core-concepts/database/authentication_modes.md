Export and Sharing 
==================
Export a Table or View
Click the []icon and choose **Export CSV** from the dropdown menu.
Check the []option to export only the currently selected database view.
You will receive an email once your export is complete.
Export Specific Records
Check the box next to the records you want to export and click the [] button.
Your export may take a few moments depending on the size, but should download automatically.
Sharing Tables & Table Views
You can share your database table with anybody, even if they don\'t have a Xano account.
Click the []button to share the database table.
[] Choose the view you want to share.
[] Choose the data source to share.
###  
Authentication Modes
[] Two-factor authentication requires the authorized user to click a link in their email before accessing the share.
[] This option will allow access to anyone with the link and a password to access the share.
[] This option will allow anyone with the link to access the share without any additional verification.
Xano recommends using **two-factor authentication (2FA)** when sharing sensitive data.
After choosing your desired authentication option, you will be presented with a link to the share and any additional settings related to the authentication method chosen. You\'ll also be able to send email invites directly from inside Xano.
###  
Deleting and Changing Share Settings
Just click the []button again to modify or delete existing shares.
