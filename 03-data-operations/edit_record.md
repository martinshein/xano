You need to tell Xano which record you want to target by providing a field\_name and field\_value. `Field_name` is the name of the database field to look inside of, and `field_value` is the value to look for in that field --- for example, `field_name: id` & `field_value: 1`
In this section, you will specify the data to be added to the record.
Click [] to quickly enable or disable all fields.
Hover over each field name and click [] to disable that field --- this means that no data will be written, or the default value in the database will be used instead, if set.
[]
If you have an object that already contains all of the data to use in the add record step, click [] to auto-fill from that variable.
###  
Customizing the return
Click [] to edit the fields returned in the query.
Note that customizing to reduce the fields returned will not have an impact on query speed, but may help with other performance issues in your function stacks. It is always good practice to only return the fields necessary.
###  
Return As
Change the variable name that this function will output to.
If you\'re using conditional steps, you can use the same variable name in multiple steps to make satisfying the conditional or outputting data in the response easier.
For example, if we are sending a specific response based on if a variable is true or false, we can set both of those outputs to the same variable, making building our response easier.
Give this function a description for easy understanding of what this function achieves.
This description will appear in the function stack, giving you easier readability for complex logic.
