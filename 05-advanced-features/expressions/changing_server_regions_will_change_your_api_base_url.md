###  
Changing server regions will change your API base URL
Your instance has a specific URL, such as https://abc1-def2-ghi3.xano.io/ and all of your API endpoints begin with this.
When you change regions, because you are migrating to a new server, your base URL will change.
After selecting your new server region, you will be given an option to beging the migration, so you have time to update anything necessary before proceeding.
**Be sure to update any external connections with the new URL prior to initiating the migration.**
2
###  
Unpublished drafts will NOT be migrated
Make sure to publish anything you want to save before proceeding.

Changing server regions is **free**, but because your subscription restarts when making this change, you will be billed at checkout for the cost of your plan, minus any unused time on your current subscription period.

###  
Scroll down to Server Region and select where you\'d like your server to be hosted.
Use the dropdown to select your region of choice.
5
###  
Proceed through checkout.
