# Release Track Preferences
## üìã **Quick Summary**

Release Track Preferences control when and how your Xano instance receives platform updates. This feature allows you to balance staying current with new features against maintaining stability for production environments.

## What You'll Learn

- How to access and configure release track settings
- Understanding the three release track options
- Setting maintenance windows for controlled updates
- Best practices for different environment types
- Enterprise manual update control

## Understanding Release Tracks

Xano continuously improves its platform with new features, bug fixes, and performance enhancements. Release tracks give you control over when these updates are applied to your instance:

**Why This Matters:**
- **Production Stability**: Avoid unexpected changes during critical business periods
- **Testing Coordination**: Align updates with your testing schedules
- **Team Preparation**: Ensure your team is ready for new features
- **Change Management**: Maintain control over your deployment environment

## Accessing Release Track Settings

1. **Navigate to Instance Settings**
   - Go to your instance selection screen
   - Click the settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è) next to your target instance

2. **Select Release Track**
   - Choose "Release Track" from the settings panel
   - Review current setting and available options

3. **Configure Preferences**
   - Select your preferred track based on plan availability
   - Set maintenance windows if using Flexible track
   - Save configuration changes

## Release Track Options

### Immediate (Default)

**How It Works:**
- Updates deploy automatically as soon as available
- No manual intervention required
- Fastest access to new features and fixes

**Best For:**
- Development environments
- Testing instances
- Teams comfortable with frequent updates
- Instances where downtime is not critical

**Considerations:**
- Updates can happen at any time
- May introduce changes during active development
- Requires team readiness for immediate changes

### Flexible

**How It Works:**
- Updates deploy during specified maintenance windows
- Choose preferred days of the week
- Control timing of update application

**Configuration Options:**

**Maintenance Window:**
- Set specific time ranges for updates
- Typically scheduled during low-traffic periods
- Coordinate with team availability
- Consider user timezone and usage patterns

**Preferred Release Days:**
- Select specific days of the week
- Common choices: Weekends, specific weekdays
- Avoid high-traffic or critical business days
- Align with team maintenance schedules

**Best For:**
- Production environments
- Instances with predictable traffic patterns
- Teams with structured maintenance schedules
- Applications requiring scheduled downtime

### Manual (Enterprise Only)

**How It Works:**
- Complete manual control over update deployment
- Updates held until explicitly approved
- Maximum control over timing and coordination

**Best For:**
- Critical production systems
- Highly regulated environments
- Complex integration dependencies
- Organizations with strict change management

**Requirements:**
- Enterprise plan subscription
- Dedicated change management processes
- Regular review of available updates
- Coordination with Xano support team

## Try This: Multi-Environment Configuration

Set up appropriate release tracks for different environment types:

```markdown
# Release Track Strategy by Environment

## Development Environment
- Track: Immediate
- Reason: Fast access to new features for testing
- Risk: Low (non-production)

## Staging Environment  
- Track: Flexible
- Window: Weekends, early morning
- Reason: Controlled testing before production
- Risk: Medium (testing impact)

## Production Environment
- Track: Flexible or Manual (Enterprise)
- Window: Sunday 2:00-4:00 AM (low traffic)
- Reason: Maximum stability and control
- Risk: High (customer impact)
```

## Setting Optimal Maintenance Windows

### Analyzing Traffic Patterns

Before setting maintenance windows, understand your usage patterns:

**Data to Review:**
- Peak usage hours and days
- Geographic distribution of users
- Critical business processes timing
- Team availability for monitoring

### Recommended Window Strategies

**Global Applications:**
```markdown
# Global Maintenance Window Strategy

## Option 1: Rolling Windows
- Different windows for different regions
- Minimize impact across time zones
- Coordinate with regional teams

## Option 2: Universal Low-Impact
- Identify globally quiet periods
- Typically weekend early morning UTC
- Shorter maintenance windows
```

**Regional Applications:**
```markdown
# Regional Maintenance Strategy

## Business Hours Consideration
- Avoid peak business hours
- Schedule during off-hours
- Consider holiday calendars

## Weekend Scheduling
- Saturday/Sunday early morning
- Friday late evening
- Coordinate with support availability
```

## Best Practices by Environment Type

### Development Environments

**Recommended Settings:**
- Release Track: Immediate
- Monitoring: Basic
- Team Preparation: Minimal required

**Benefits:**
- Access to latest features immediately
- Early identification of potential issues
- Faster development cycle capability

### Staging Environments

**Recommended Settings:**
- Release Track: Flexible
- Maintenance Window: Weekends or early mornings
- Team Preparation: Moderate

**Strategy:**
- Test updates before production deployment
- Validate integrations and functionality
- Prepare team for production changes

### Production Environments

**Recommended Settings:**
- Release Track: Flexible (or Manual for Enterprise)
- Maintenance Window: Carefully chosen low-impact periods
- Team Preparation: Full preparation and monitoring

**Critical Considerations:**
- User impact minimization
- Rollback procedures ready
- Team availability during windows
- Customer communication if needed

## Team Coordination Strategies

### Pre-Update Preparation

```markdown
# Update Preparation Checklist

## Technical Preparation
- [ ] Review update notes and changes
- [ ] Backup critical data and configurations
- [ ] Test in staging environment first
- [ ] Prepare rollback procedures

## Team Coordination
- [ ] Notify team of update schedule
- [ ] Assign monitoring responsibilities
- [ ] Plan post-update validation
- [ ] Coordinate with customer support

## Communication
- [ ] Inform stakeholders of maintenance window
- [ ] Prepare customer notifications if needed
- [ ] Document expected changes
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
```

### Post-Update Monitoring

**Immediate Checks:**
- API functionality validation
- Performance monitoring
- Error rate assessment
- User experience verification

**Extended Monitoring:**
- System stability over 24-48 hours
- Integration point validation
- User feedback collection
- Performance trend analysis

## Integration with CI/CD Workflows

### Coordinating with Development Cycles

**Sprint Planning Integration:**
- Schedule updates during sprint breaks
- Avoid updates during feature releases
- Coordinate with testing phases
- Plan for update-related adjustments

**Release Coordination:**
- Align Xano updates with application releases
- Test compatibility before production deployment
- Prepare for potential integration updates
- Document version dependencies

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Ignoring Traffic Patterns**: Scheduling updates during peak usage
2. **Insufficient Testing**: Not testing updates in staging first
3. **Poor Communication**: Not notifying teams or users appropriately
4. **No Rollback Plan**: Lacking procedures for reverting changes
5. **Inconsistent Strategy**: Different tracks without clear reasoning

## Pro Tips

1. **Environment Alignment**: Use consistent strategies across similar environments
2. **Documentation**: Keep records of update schedules and outcomes
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Establish automated monitoring for post-update validation
4. **Team Training**: Ensure team understands update processes and procedures
5. **Customer Communication**: Prepare templates for user notifications when needed
6. **Performance Baseline**: Establish performance baselines for comparison
