## Accessing Xano Link

Xano Link is accessed from the source workspace that contains your master configuration:

1. **Navigate to Source Workspace**
   - Open the workspace you want to deploy from
   - This becomes your "source" workspace

2. **Access Xano Link Settings**
   - Go to workspace settings
   - Find and select "Xano Link"
   - Configure deployment options

3. **Configure Deployment Content**
   - Select APIs, functions, addons, and database tables
   - Use bulk selection tools for efficiency
   - Enable automatic dependency inclusion

## Content Selection Strategies

### Smart Selection Tools

**Select All/None Options:**
- Quickly bulk select or deselect all items
- Useful for starting with everything then removing exceptions
- Saves time when deploying comprehensive updates

**Auto Include Dependencies:**
- Automatically includes dependent components
- Example: Selecting an API automatically includes its custom functions
- Prevents broken deployments due to missing dependencies
- Essential for maintaining functional integrity

### Recommended Selection Approach

```markdown
# Deployment Content Strategy

## Core Functionality (Always Include)
- Essential API endpoints
- Core database tables
- Authentication functions
- Critical business logic

## Optional Components (Selective)
- Client-specific customizations
- Development/testing functions
- Experimental features
- Environment-specific configurations

## Exclude from Deployment
- Client-specific data
- Environment variables
- Development debugging tools
- Temporary testing components
```

## Database Table Merging

### Understanding Table Selection

When deploying database tables, you have granular control:

**Schema-Only Deployment:**
- Deploy table structure without data
- Ideal for new environments
- Preserves existing data in destination

**Schema + Data Deployment:**
- Deploy structure and selected records
- Use for reference data or seed content
- Click record count to choose specific records

### GUID Management for Existing Tables

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: When destination workspace already has matching tables, GUID synchronization prevents duplicate tables.

**GUID Synchronization Process:**

1. **Access Source Table Settings**
   - Go to source table
   - Click three dots (‚ãÆ) in top-right
   - Choose "Security" option

2. **Copy Source GUID**
   - Click "Show Advanced Settings"
   - Copy the GUID value displayed
   - Store securely for next step

3. **Update Destination Table**
   - Navigate to destination workspace
   - Access matching table settings
   - Replace destination GUID with source GUID
   - Save changes immediately

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: GUID changes are advanced operations. Test in development environments first.

## Deployment Options and Branching

### Branch Management Strategies

**Merge New Branch with Existing Live:**
- Combines deployed changes with current live branch
- Preserves client customizations
- Recommended for incremental updates

**Set New Branch Live:**
- Immediately activates deployed branch
- Replaces current live branch
- Use for major updates or fresh deployments

### Safe Deployment Workflow

```markdown
# Recommended Deployment Process

## 1. Pre-Deployment
- Create backup of destination workspace
- Review change comparison
- Notify affected users of deployment window
- Test deployment in staging environment

## 2. Deployment
- Deploy to new branch (don't set live immediately)
- Test functionality in destination workspace
- Verify integrations and customizations
- Review performance and functionality

## 3. Activation
- Set new branch live after validation
- Monitor for issues post-deployment
- Keep previous branch available for rollback
- Document deployment changes and outcomes
```

## Try This: Multi-Environment Deployment

Set up a deployment pipeline for development to production:

```markdown
# Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production Pipeline

## Development Workspace (Source)
1. Create and test new features
2. Use Xano Link to deploy to staging
3. Select: APIs, functions, table schemas
4. Exclude: development data, debug functions

## Staging Workspace (Testing)
1. Receive deployment from development
2. Test with production-like data
3. Validate integrations and performance
4. Approve for production deployment

## Production Workspace (Live)
1. Deploy validated changes from staging
2. Use "Merge with Live" for safety
3. Monitor performance and functionality
4. Keep rollback branch available
```

## Client Customization Strategies

### Additive Customization Approach

**Recommended Method**: Add client-specific components without modifying core deployment:

- **Additional Tables**: Client-specific data storage
- **Custom APIs**: Client-unique functionality
- **Supplementary Functions**: Client-specific business logic
- **Environment Variables**: Client-specific configurations

**Why This Works:**
- Core functionality remains updateable
- Customizations survive deployments
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier maintenance and support

### Workspace Naming Conventions

```markdown
# Recommended Naming Strategy

## Source Workspaces
- ProductName:Master
- ProductName:Source
- CompanyApp:Template

## Client Workspaces
- ProductName:ClientA
- ProductName:ClientB-Staging
- CompanyApp:DemoEnvironment

## Environment Suffixes
- :Dev (development)
- :Staging (testing)
- :Prod (production)
- :Demo (demonstration)
```

## Change Comparison and Review

### Pre-Deployment Review Process

1. **Enable Comparison Mode**
   - Select "Merge New Branch" option
   - Choose destination workspace
   - Click "View" to see differences

2. **Review Changed Items**
   - Examine list of modified components
   - Click "changes" next to items for details
   - Validate impact of each change

3. **Understand Change Types**
   - **Additions**: New components being deployed
   - **Modifications**: Changes to existing components
   - **Deletions**: Components removed from source

### Change Impact Assessment

```markdown
# Change Review Checklist

## API Changes
- [ ] Endpoint URLs remain consistent
- [ ] Request/response formats maintained
- [ ] Authentication requirements unchanged
- [ ] Rate limiting implications reviewed

## Database Changes

### Team Collaboration

**Communication Protocol:**
- Notify teams before deployments
- Document what's being deployed
- Coordinate with client teams
- Establish rollback procedures

**Documentation Standards:**
- Maintain deployment logs
- Track client customizations
- Document GUID mappings
- Record rollback procedures

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **GUID Mismanagement**: Not synchronizing GUIDs for existing tables
2. **Dependency Oversight**: Missing dependent components in deployment
3. **Data Overwriting**: Accidentally overwriting client data
4. **Branch Confusion**: Not understanding branch merge implications
5. **Testing Neglect**: Deploying without adequate testing
6. **Documentation Gaps**: Poor tracking of customizations and changes

## Pro Tips

1. **Staging First**: Always deploy to staging before production
2. **Incremental Deployments**: Deploy smaller, more frequent updates
3. **Version Control**: Use workspace naming to track versions
4. **Client Communication**: Keep clients informed of deployment schedules
5. **Rollback Readiness**: Always have rollback procedures documented
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Watch for performance impacts post-deployment

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Duplicate Table Problems
- **Cause**: GUID mismatch between source and destination
- **Solution**: Synchronize GUIDs before deployment
- **Prevention**: Maintain GUID mapping documentation

### Missing Dependencies
- **Cause**: Not using auto-include dependencies
- **Solution**: Enable auto-include or manually select dependencies
- **Prevention**: Review dependency relationships before deployment

### Client Customization Loss
- **Cause**: Modifying source components that clients customized
- **Solution**: Use additive customization approach
- **Prevention**: Clear separation between core and custom components

Xano Link provides powerful capabilities for managing multi-workspace deployments, enabling agencies and development teams to maintain consistency while allowing client-specific customizations. By following structured deployment processes and best practices, you can create reliable, scalable deployment workflows that support both standardization and customization needs.
