## Accessing Audit Logs

### From Workspace Dashboard

1. **Open Workspace Menu**
   - Navigate to your target workspace
   - Click the three dots (â‹®) in the top-right corner

2. **Select Audit Logs**
   - Choose "Audit Logs" from the dropdown menu
   - Access the comprehensive logging interface

### From Instance Settings

For instance-wide audit logs across all workspaces:

1. **Go to Instance Selection**
   - Navigate to your instance selection screen
   - Access settings from the main instance panel

2. **Instance-Level Logging**
   - View consolidated logs across all workspaces
   - Useful for administrators managing multiple workspaces

### Permission Requirements

**RBAC Consideration**: Users need **Workspace Logs** permission when RBAC is enabled
- Configure permissions through workspace settings
- Ensure team members have appropriate access levels
- Consider read-only access for most team members

## Advanced Search and Filtering

### Search Functionality

**Current Limitation**: Search functionality targets event summary titles only
- Search terms match against event descriptions
- Use specific keywords related to actions (create, update, delete)
- Include resource names for more targeted results

**Search Examples:**
```markdown
# Effective Search Terms
- "Create Table users"
- "Update API login"
- "Delete Function validate"
- "Merge Branch feature"
- "Set Live Branch"
```

### Filtering Options

**Event Types**: Filter by specific operation categories
- Database operations
- API changes
- Function modifications
- Branch operations
- User management

**Users**: Filter by team member who performed actions
- Individual user tracking
- Team activity analysis
- Accountability and attribution

**Labels**: Use category-based filtering
- System events vs. user actions
- Production vs. development changes
- Automated vs. manual operations

**Time Ranges**: Focus on specific periods
- Recent changes for debugging
- Historical analysis for compliance
- Incident investigation timeframes

## Try This: Debugging Workflow

Use audit logs to trace a production issue:

```markdown
# Debugging with Audit Logs

## Step 1: Identify Issue Timeline
1. Note when issue was first reported
2. Search logs for events around that time
3. Filter by production branch activities

## Step 2: Trace Recent Changes
1. Filter by event types: API, Function, Database
2. Look for changes in the hours before issue
3. Identify potential culprit modifications

## Step 3: Analyze Change Details
1. Click on suspicious events for details
2. Review before/after state information
3. Use "Go To" buttons to examine current state

## Step 4: Correlate with Performance
1. Cross-reference with monitoring data
2. Check request history for performance impact
3. Identify specific changes causing issues

## Step 5: Plan Resolution
1. Document findings from audit trail
2. Plan rollback or fix strategy
3. Communicate timeline to stakeholders
```

## Integration Patterns

### Compliance Monitoring

Build automated compliance workflows:

```javascript
// Daily compliance report generator
async function generateComplianceReport(startDate, endDate) {
  const searchParams = {
    "page": 1,
    "per_page": 1000,
    "include_data": true,
    "search": [
      {
        "field": "created_at",
        "operator": ">=",
        "value": startDate
      },
      {
        "field": "created_at",
        "operator": "<=",
        "value": endDate
      }
    ]
  };
  
  const response = await fetch('/api:meta/audit_log/search', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + complianceToken,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(searchParams)
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  // Process for compliance reporting
  const report = {
    period: { start: startDate, end: endDate },
    totalEvents: data.itemsTotal,
    eventsByType: {},
    userActivity: {},
    criticalChanges: []
  };
  
  data.items.forEach(event => {
    // Categorize events
    report.eventsByType[event.type] = (report.eventsByType[event.type] || 0) + 1;
    
    // Track user activity
    const userName = event.user.name;
    report.userActivity[userName] = (report.userActivity[userName] || 0) + 1;
    
    // Flag critical changes
    if (event.type.includes('Delete') || event.type.includes('Live Branch')) {
      report.criticalChanges.push({
        type: event.type,
        user: userName,
        time: event.created_at,
        description: event.msg
      });
    }
  });
  
  return report;
}
```

### Security Monitoring

Implement security alerting:

```javascript
// Security monitoring for unusual activity
async function monitorSecurityEvents() {
  const securityEvents = [
    'Delete Workspace',
    'Delete Table', 
    'Impersonate Tenant',
    'Update Tenant License',
    'Set Live Branch'
  ];
  
  const searches = securityEvents.map(eventType => ({
    "field": "type",
    "operator": "=",
    "value": eventType
  }));
  
  const response = await fetch('/api:meta/audit_log/search', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + securityToken,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      "page": 1,
      "per_page": 100,
      "search": [
        {
          "field": "created_at",
          "operator": ">",
          "value": new Date(Date.now() - 24*60*60*1000).toISOString() // Last 24 hours
        }
      ]
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  const securityAlerts = data.items.filter(event => 
    securityEvents.includes(event.type)
  );
  
  if (securityAlerts.length > 0) {
    // Send alerts to security team
    await sendSecurityAlert(securityAlerts);
  }
  
  return securityAlerts;
}
```

### Team Activity Dashboard

Create team activity monitoring:

```javascript
// Team activity dashboard data
async function getTeamActivity(timeRange = '7d') {
  const startDate = new Date();
  startDate.setDate(startDate.getDate() - parseInt(timeRange));
  
  const response = await fetch('/api:meta/audit_log/search', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + dashboardToken,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      "page": 1,
      "per_page": 1000,
      "search": [
        {
          "field": "created_at",
          "operator": ">",
          "value": startDate.toISOString()
        }
      ]
    })
  });
  
  const data = await response.json();
  
  // Aggregate team activity
  const teamMetrics = {
    totalActivity: data.itemsTotal,
    activeUsers: new Set(),
    activityByDay: {},
    topActions: {},
    recentActivity: data.items.slice(0, 10)
  };
  
  data.items.forEach(event => {
    teamMetrics.activeUsers.add(event.user.name);
    
    const day = event.created_at.split('T')[0];
    teamMetrics.activityByDay[day] = (teamMetrics.activityByDay[day] || 0) + 1;
    
    teamMetrics.topActions[event.type] = (teamMetrics.topActions[event.type] || 0) + 1;
  });
  
  teamMetrics.activeUsers = teamMetrics.activeUsers.size;
  
  return teamMetrics;
}
```

## Best Practices

### Monitoring and Alerting

2. **Storage Planning**: Consider storage costs for high-activity workspaces
3. **Access Control**: Limit audit log access to appropriate team members
4. **Retention Awareness**: Understand retention limits for your plan
5. **Backup Integration**: Include audit logs in disaster recovery planning

### Team Collaboration

1. **Change Communication**: Use audit logs to communicate team changes
2. **Training**: Train team members on audit log interpretation
3. **Documentation**: Document critical changes with audit log references
4. **Incident Response**: Establish audit log procedures for incident response
5. **Accountability**: Use logs to maintain development accountability

## Common Use Cases

### Compliance Reporting

Generate monthly compliance reports showing all workspace changes, user activities, and critical operations for regulatory requirements.

### Incident Investigation

Trace production issues back to specific changes using timestamp correlation and detailed change information.

### Performance Analysis

Identify performance-impacting changes by correlating audit log timestamps with performance metrics.

### Security Auditing

Monitor for unauthorized access, suspicious activities, and security-relevant changes across all workspaces.

### Team Coordination

Track team member activities, understand change patterns, and coordinate development efforts.

### Change Management

Maintain detailed records of all changes for change management processes and approval workflows.
