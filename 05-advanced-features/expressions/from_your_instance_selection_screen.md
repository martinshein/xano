Backup and Restore 
==================
How do backups work in Xano?
On all of our paid plans, Xano keeps a rolling 3-day backup of your entire instance automatically, should the need arise to restore to an earlier point.
You also have the ability to take and restore backups manually.
If you are on a free plan, please note that **no backups are available**.
Creating a Backup
<div>
1
###  
From your instance selection screen
, click [] next to the instance you want to create a backup of.
2
###  
In the panel that opens, choose Database Backup.
3
###  
Click Manual Backup
4
###  
Check the option to include media storage if you\'d like that to be included in your backup.
Please note that media storage should only be backed up if absolutely necessary, as it can greatly increase the size of and duration to backup / restore the instance.
5
###  
Click [] to start the process.
</div>
Restoring a Backup
WARNING
It is **strongly advised** that you first create a backup before restoring another, just in case you need to roll back.
<div>
1
###  
From your instance selection screen

2
###  
In the panel that opens, choose Database Backup.
3
###  
Click Download and Restore
4
###  
Choose the backup you\'d like to restore and click []
</div>
Custom Backup Policy
You can define your own custom schedule for when automatic backups take place.
<div>
1
###  
From your instance selection screen
, click [] next to the instance you want to adjust backup policy for.
2
###  
In the panel that opens, choose Database Backup.
3
###  
Click Policy
4
###  
Choose the time window you\'d like your backups to run in.
Typically, backups will happen early morning PST hours. However, you can select your own time window to more closely align with your needs from here.
