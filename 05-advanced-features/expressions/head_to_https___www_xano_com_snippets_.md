Snippets 
========
Snippets are an easy way to share API endpoints, custom functions, AI agents, MCP servers, and more with the Xano community. When you share a Snippet, it will be available for anyone to add to their own workspace.
Snippets will, by default, contain everything necessary to include with what you\'ve selected. This means that if you create a Snippet that has APIs inside of it, for example, any referenced tables will be included as well. You can always edit or add to what is included in this Snippet. **No one will have access to your workspace, and data is not included.**
You can see some of the Snippets that have been created by the Xano community and featured by our team at xano.com/snippet. You can preview a Snippet before installing it into your workspace(s).
