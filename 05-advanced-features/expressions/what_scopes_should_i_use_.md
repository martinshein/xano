###  
What scopes should I use?
While it\'s hard to answer this question without specific knowledge of your use case, here are some examples of proper scoping that might make sense.
####  
**WeWeb**
To use WeWeb\'s Xano plugin(s), you\'ll need the following scopes.
Scope
C
R
U
D
Why?
Workspace API Groups
WeWeb needs to be able to read information about your API groups and available APIs.
Workspace Content
WeWeb needs to know about your available workspaces.
####  
**Monitoring and Logging**
For monitoring and logging tools, you might need the following scopes.
Scope
C
R
U
D
Why?
Workspace API Groups
For getting specific information about APIs it is monitoring
Workspace Content
General information about your available workspaces.
Workspace Request History
Specific request history data for parsing and logging
