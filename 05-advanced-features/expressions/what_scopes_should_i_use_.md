# Xano API Token Scopes Guide
## ðŸ“‹ **Quick Summary**

Xano API token scopes provide granular access control for third-party integrations and external tools. Understanding and properly configuring scopes ensures secure integration with platforms like WeWeb, Make.com, n8n, and monitoring tools while following the principle of least privilege.

## What You'll Learn

- Understanding CRUD permissions for each scope
- Complete reference of all available scopes
- Recommended scope configurations for common integrations
- Security best practices for token management
- Examples for WeWeb, monitoring, and automation platforms

## Understanding CRUD Permissions

Each scope in Xano follows the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) permission model, allowing fine-grained access control:

**C (Create)**: Create new data within the scope
**R (Read)**: Read existing data within the scope  
**U (Update)**: Update existing data within the scope
**D (Delete)**: Delete data within the scope

**Permission Management Tips:**
- Hover over permission checkboxes to see + or - options
- Use bulk selection for efficient configuration
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regular review and rotation of permissions

## Security Best Practices

### Token Management

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions
2. **Regular Rotation**: Rotate tokens on a schedule (monthly/quarterly)
3. **Environment Separation**: Use different tokens for dev/staging/production
4. **Monitoring**: Track token usage through request history
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear records of token purposes and scopes

### Access Control Strategies

**Development Environment:**
```markdown
# Development Token Configuration
- Broader permissions for testing
- Shorter rotation cycles
- Enhanced monitoring and logging
- Clear expiration dates
```

**Production Environment:**
```markdown
# Production Token Configuration
- Minimal required permissions only
- Longer rotation cycles for stability
- IP restrictions where possible
- Comprehensive audit logging
```

### Audit and Compliance

1. **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly scope and permission audits
2. **Usage Monitoring**: Track API usage patterns and anomalies
3. **Access Logging**: Maintain detailed logs of token usage
4. **Incident Response**: Procedures for token compromise
5. **Compliance Documentation**: Maintain compliance with security policies

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-Permissioning**: Granting more access than necessary
2. **Token Sharing**: Using same token across multiple integrations
3. **Indefinite Tokens**: Not implementing rotation schedules
4. **Insufficient Monitoring**: Not tracking token usage patterns
5. **Documentation Neglect**: Not maintaining clear scope documentation

## Pro Tips

1. **Start Minimal**: Begin with read-only access and add permissions as needed
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate integrations work with minimal scopes
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Name tokens clearly for their intended purpose
4. **Implement Alerts**: Set up monitoring for unusual token usage
5. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove unused or expired tokens
6. **Team Training**: Ensure team understands scope implications

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Access Denied Errors
- **Check Scope Configuration**: Verify required permissions are granted
- **Token Validity**: Ensure token hasn't expired
- **IP Restrictions**: Confirm requests originate from allowed IPs
- **Rate Limiting**: Check if requests are being throttled

### Integration Failures
- **Permission Mismatch**: Compare required vs. granted permissions
- **Token Format**: Verify correct token format and headers
- **Endpoint Access**: Confirm endpoints are accessible with current scopes
- **Network Issues**: Check connectivity and firewall settings

### Performance Issues
- **Over-Scoping**: Too broad permissions may impact performance
- **Rate Limits**: Monitor request frequency and implement backoff
- **Token Overhead**: Multiple tokens may create unnecessary overhead
- **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies

By carefully selecting appropriate scopes for each integration, you can maintain security while enabling powerful third-party functionality. Regular review and optimization of scope configurations ensures your Xano integrations remain secure, efficient, and compliant with your organization's security policies.
