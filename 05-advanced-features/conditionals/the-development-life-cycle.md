        progress: progress,
        timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
      })
    });
  }
}
```

## ðŸ’¡ **Best Practices for Each Phase**

### Planning Phase
- **Start Small**: Focus on MVP (Minimum Viable Product) features
- **User-Centric**: Always prioritize user needs over technical preferences
- **Document Everything**: Clear requirements prevent scope creep
- **Set Realistic Timelines**: Allow buffer time for unexpected challenges

### Design Phase
- **Think in Systems**: Design reusable components and patterns
- **Plan for Scale**: Consider future growth and expansion
- **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile devices from the start
- **Accessibility**: Ensure inclusive design for all users

### Development Phase
- **Version Control**: Use branching strategies for collaborative development
- **Code Reviews**: Implement peer review processes
- **Documentation**: Keep API and system documentation current
- **Testing Early**: Write tests as you develop, not after

### Testing Phase
- **Automate Tests**: Use automated testing for regression prevention
- **Real User Testing**: Test with actual users, not just internal teams
- **Edge Cases**: Test unusual scenarios and error conditions
- **Performance**: Test under realistic load conditions

### Deployment Phase
- **Staged Rollouts**: Deploy gradually to minimize risk
- **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive monitoring from day one
- **Rollback Plans**: Always have a way to revert changes quickly
- **Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed throughout deployment

### Maintenance Phase
- **Regular Updates**: Schedule regular maintenance and updates
- **User Feedback**: Continuously collect and act on user feedback
- **Security**: Stay current with security patches and best practices
- **Performance**: Monitor and optimize performance continuously

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting Common SDLC Issues**

### Planning Issues
**Problem**: Unclear or changing requirements  
**Solution**: Implement regular stakeholder reviews and change management processes

**Problem**: Unrealistic timeline expectations  
**Solution**: Use historical data and buffer time for accurate estimation

### Development Issues
**Problem**: Technical debt accumulation  
**Solution**: Regular code reviews and refactoring sprints

**Problem**: Integration challenges  
**Solution**: Early integration testing and API contract validation

### Testing Issues
**Problem**: Insufficient test coverage  
**Solution**: Implement test-driven development and automated testing

**Problem**: Late discovery of critical bugs  
**Solution**: Continuous testing throughout development phases

### Deployment Issues
**Problem**: Environment inconsistencies  
**Solution**: Use infrastructure as code and environment parity

**Problem**: Rollback difficulties  
**Solution**: Implement blue-green deployments and database migration strategies
