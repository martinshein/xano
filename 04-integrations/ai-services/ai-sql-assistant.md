## 🛡️ **Security Best Practices**

### Preventing SQL Injection

**Always use Xano's security filters before incorporating user input:**

```sql
-- Safe dynamic query with parameterization
SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE email = ? 
AND status = ?
```

**Required Security Filters:**

| Filter | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `sql_esc` | Escapes special characters | `{{ user_input\|sql_esc }}` |
| `sql_alias` | Sanitizes table/column names | `{{ table_name\|sql_alias }}` |

### Function Stack Security Pattern

```javascript
// Function stack with proper input sanitization
[
  {
    "function": "create_variable",
    "name": "safe_email",
    "value": "{{ request.body.email|sql_esc }}"
  },
  {
    "function": "direct_database_query",
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?",
    "parameters": ["{{ safe_email }}"]
  }
]
```

## 🔗 **No-Code Platform Integration**

### n8n Integration

**AI-Generated Query in n8n Workflow:**

```javascript
// HTTP Request node for AI SQL query generation
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://your-xano-instance.com/api/smart-query",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{ $json.auth_token }}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body": {
    "query_description": "{{ $json.search_criteria }}",
    "table_context": "{{ $json.table_info }}",
    "security_level": "high"
  }
}
```

### WeWeb Integration

**Dynamic Query Builder Component:**

```javascript
// WeWeb component for AI-powered database queries
async function executeSmartQuery(description, filters) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${wwLib.wwVariable.getValue('xano_base_url')}/api/ai-sql-query`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${wwLib.wwVariable.getValue('auth_token')}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        description: description,
        filters: filters,
        output_format: 'optimized'
      })
    });
    
    const queryResult = await response.json();
    
    // Update UI with results
    wwLib.wwVariable.updateValue('query_results', queryResult.data);
    wwLib.wwVariable.updateValue('query_explanation', queryResult.explanation);
    
    return queryResult;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Smart query failed:', error);
    return { data: [], error: 'Query generation unavailable' };
  }
}
```

## 🛠️ **Advanced Usage Examples**

### Example 1: Customer Analytics Query

**Natural Language Request:**
```
"Show me customer lifetime value analysis - include customer email, total orders, 
total spent, average order value, and days since last purchase. 
Only include customers with at least 3 orders."
```

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT 
  u.email,
  COUNT(o.id) as total_orders,
  SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent,
  AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value,
  DATEDIFF(NOW(), MAX(o.created_at)) as days_since_last_purchase
FROM users u
INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY u.id, u.email
HAVING COUNT(o.id) >= 3
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

### Example 2: Inventory Management Query

**Natural Language Request:**
```
"Find products that are running low on inventory - less than 10 units in stock, 
show product name, current stock, reorder level, and supplier information."
```

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
SELECT 
  p.name as product_name,
  p.stock_quantity as current_stock,
  p.reorder_level,
  s.name as supplier_name,
  s.contact_email as supplier_email
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN suppliers s ON p.supplier_id = s.id
WHERE p.stock_quantity < 10
AND p.status = 'active'
ORDER BY p.stock_quantity ASC;
```

### Example 3: Performance Analytics

**Natural Language Request:**
```
"Create a monthly sales report showing month, total revenue, number of orders, 
average order value, and percentage growth compared to previous month."
```

**Generated SQL:**
```sql
WITH monthly_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%m') as month,
    SUM(total_amount) as revenue,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value
  FROM orders 
  WHERE status = 'completed'
    AND created_at >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 12 MONTH)
  GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(created_at, '%Y-%m')
),
with_growth AS (
  SELECT *,
    LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) as prev_month_revenue,
    ((revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month)) / LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY month) * 100) as growth_percentage
  FROM monthly_stats
)
SELECT 
  month,
  ROUND(revenue, 2) as total_revenue,
  order_count,
  ROUND(avg_order_value, 2) as avg_order_value,
  ROUND(COALESCE(growth_percentage, 0), 2) as growth_percentage
FROM with_growth
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

## Query Optimization Patterns

### Performance Optimization

**AI Suggested Improvements:**

```sql
-- Before: Inefficient query
SELECT * FROM orders o, users u 
WHERE o.user_id = u.id 
AND o.created_at > '2024-01-01';

-- After: Optimized with proper JOIN and indexing
SELECT o.id, o.total_amount, u.email, u.name
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
WHERE o.created_at > '2024-01-01'
AND o.status = 'completed'
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### Dynamic Query Patterns

**Parameterized Queries for Function Stacks:**

```javascript
// Function stack with dynamic AI-generated query
[
  {
    "function": "create_variable",
    "name": "date_filter",
    "value": "{{ request.body.start_date|sql_esc }}"
  },
  {
    "function": "create_variable", 
    "name": "status_filter",
    "value": "{{ request.body.status|sql_esc }}"
  },
  {
    "function": "direct_database_query",
    "sql": "SELECT u.email, COUNT(o.id) as order_count, SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent FROM users u LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id WHERE o.created_at >= ? AND o.status = ? GROUP BY u.id ORDER BY total_spent DESC",
    "parameters": ["{{ date_filter }}", "{{ status_filter }}"]
  }
]
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Query Explanation Mode

The AI assistant provides detailed explanations:

```
QUERY EXPLANATION:

1. SELECT clause: Retrieves customer email and calculated metrics
2. JOIN operations: Connects users table with orders table
3. WHERE conditions: Filters for completed orders after specified date
4. GROUP BY: Aggregates data per customer
5. HAVING clause: Excludes customers with fewer than 3 orders
6. ORDER BY: Sorts by total spending (highest first)

PERFORMANCE NOTES:
- Query uses proper INNER JOIN for better performance
- Date filtering applied early to reduce dataset
- Aggregation performed after filtering for efficiency
```

### 2. Schema-Aware Suggestions

The assistant automatically suggests:
- Available table relationships
- Optimal join conditions
- Appropriate data types
- Index utilization opportunities

### 3. Query Validation

**Automatic Validation Includes:**
- Syntax checking
- Table and column existence
- Data type compatibility
- Performance impact assessment
- Security vulnerability scanning

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

**Problem**: AI generates incorrect table names  
**Solution**: Refresh database schema in the assistant, verify table permissions

**Problem**: Query returns unexpected results  
**Solution**: Review JOIN conditions, check data types, validate filter logic

**Problem**: Performance issues with large datasets  
**Solution**: Add LIMIT clauses, use appropriate indexes, consider query optimization

**Problem**: SQL injection warnings  
**Solution**: Always use parameterized queries and security filters

### Optimization Tips

1. **Use Specific Columns**: Avoid `SELECT *` for better performance
2. **Add Indexes**: Create indexes on frequently queried columns
3. **Limit Results**: Use LIMIT and OFFSET for pagination
4. **Filter Early**: Apply WHERE conditions before JOINs when possible
5. **Monitor Performance**: Use Xano's request history to track query performance

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

- **Be Specific**: Detailed prompts generate better queries
