1.  Build For AI
Agents 
======
Agents are used to perform \'fuzzy logic\', or perform workflows that require intricate decision making powered by an AI model
####  
**Not looking for Agents, and just want to connect to your favorite AI models, like ChatGPT?**
**Check out this resource instead:** Chatbots
Quick Summary
AI agents in Xano refer to autonomous entities designed to perform tasks by leveraging artificial intelligence. Your Xano Agents can integrate with your database, APIs, tasks, and functions, as well as external systems.
These agents can process data, make decisions, and execute actions without human intervention. AI agents in Xano can efficiently handle a variety of applications, from chatbots to data analysis tools, enhancing automation and productivity.

What are Agents?
AI agents in Xano serve as integral components for building intelligent, automated systems as a part of your backend. These agents are designed to function autonomously, interacting with various elements of your app such as your APIs and database, as well as external systems, to streamline operations and enhance efficiency. AI agents can intelligently interpret inputs, process data, and deliver actionable outputs, all without the need for continuous human oversight.
Agents in Xano can leverage any of the most popular AI models once you provide an API key, such as:
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    OpenAI
    :::
-   ::: 
    :::

    Anthropic / Claude
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    Google Gemini
    :::
You can leverage the same visual builder you\'re used to using today to create workflows and functions that enable the agents to interact seamlessly with databases and external systems. With these foundational elements in place, AI agents can execute complex tasks, perform data analysis, or even serve as intelligent chatbots, making them versatile tools for a wide range of applications.

Fill out the necessary information
Note
Please note that **not all models support certain features** such as:
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    Structured outputs
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::

    ::: 
    Reasoning
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    Tool calls
    :::
In addition, some models may support individual features, but not **combinations of features**, such as:
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    Structured outputs with tool calls
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    Tool calls with reasoning
    :::
This is not an issue with Xano or with your agent builds --- this is dictated by the model you\'re using. If you encounter errors when testing your Agents, try using a different model and check to make sure that your model supports the feature(s) you have enabled, especially if you are using more than one of these features together.
Use the **Prompt Assistant** to help you build the best system prompts for your Agents!

###  
Add some tools to your Agent
An Agent needs tools to function --- the tools are essentially single functions that the Agent can perform, such as looking up user data or cancelling a subscription.
<div>
</div>
###  
Using Existing Function Stacks as Tools
<div>
1
####  
In the existing function stack, click the ‚ãÆ settings icon in the upper-right corner of another function stack, and click [ Use As AI Tool ]
2
####  
Choose the Agent or MCP Server you\'d like to add the tool to, and give it a name. This name is what the command will be, so make sure it\'s understandable
3
####  
A new tool will be created in your chosen destination with a function to call the function stack
Xano will not make a copy of your existing function stack; instead, it will use a Run Endpoint function and call that function stack internally. This is ideal, so you only have to maintain one function stack.
A tool created from an existing API endpoint
4
####  
Head to your tool\'s settings and add instructions
Instructions are important to have so the AI models and clients interacting with this tool understand how to use it.

###  
Creating Tools from Scratch

####  
Build your tool\'s function stack
If you haven\'t already, make sure you\'re familiar with Building with Visual Development
4
####  
Add the tool to an Agent or MCP Server
From the Agent or MCP Server, choose + Add Tool and select the tool you just created.
</div>
</div>
Running your Agent
Your Agents will be called as a part of another function stack using the **Call AI Agent** function.
<div>
1
###  
Add the Call AI Agent function to your function stack
2
###  
Select your Agent from the list
3
###  
Configure your Agent\'s arguments and options
In the `args` section, define a JSON object by typing `` into the box.
You can also just copy and paste an entire JSON object here to speed up the process, if you have that available.
Use the Set filter by clicking Set when hovering over the value box.
Set requires a key and a value --- the key is essentially \"this is the type of data\" and the value is the data itself. These are going to correspond to the arguments you defined when setting up your agent.
For example, if my system prompt looks like this:
`Please use the customer data here: {} to answer the customer question`
Your args would look like this, replacing the value with actual customer information.
In the `allow_tool_execution` section, you can decide whether or not this run should allow execution of any tools the agent has access to using a `true` or `false` value.
</div>
Structured Outputs
Structured Outputs are used for providing a specific format that you need your agent to return its result as. This is especially useful when you are calling agents from other agents and want to ensure that the output from Agent 1 is clear and easy to understand for Agent 2.
You can add structured outputs to your Agent in the settings by checking the Structured Outputs checkbox, and then clicking [ + Add Output Schema ] to build your output schema.
Example Agents
###  
[ü§ñ] Customer Support Agent
**Purpose**
This Agent is designed to handle customer inquiries that don\'t typically need human interaction.
**Tools**
An Agent designed for this purpose might have the following tools available:
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    **Get User Information**
    -   ::: 
        ::: 
        :::
        :::
        ::: 
        Retrieves user information from the database
        :::
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    **Update User Information**
    -   ::: 
        ::: 
        :::
        :::
        ::: 
        Retrieves existing user information from the database, and updates it per a user\'s request, such as changing their phone number or address
        :::
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    **Send Verification Code**
    -   ::: 
        ::: 
        :::
        :::
        ::: 
        This tool could be used as a secondary security measure to verify that the request is coming from the user that the data belongs to
        :::
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    **Change Subscription**
    -   ::: 
        ::: 
        :::
        :::
        ::: 
        Based on the user\'s request, this could be used to stop an upcoming renewal, or cancel a subscription immediately. Because Agents excel at \'fuzzy logic\' depending on certain circumstances, this could also be used for things like churn prevention --- dynamically offering the user a discount to stay, for example
        :::
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    **Search Documentation**
    -   ::: 
        ::: 
        :::
        :::
        ::: 
        Calls an external API from your chosen documentation platform to search your product documentation in an attempt to solve the user\'s query without human intervention
        :::
    :::
-   ::: 
    ::: 
    :::
    :::
    ::: 
    **Create Support Ticket**
    -   ::: 
        ::: 
        :::
        :::
        ::: 
        In the case that the Agent does not have the necessary tools to solve the user\'s concerns, create a support ticket for human intervention
        :::
