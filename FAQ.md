# Xano Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Xano?
Xano is a no-code backend platform that allows you to build scalable APIs, manage databases, and create business logic without writing traditional code.

### How does Xano differ from n8n?
While n8n focuses on workflow automation and integration between services, Xano is a complete backend platform that includes:
- Database management
- API creation
- User authentication
- File storage
- Real-time capabilities

### Can I migrate from n8n to Xano?
Yes, but they serve different purposes. Xano can replace backend services while n8n excels at automation workflows. Many users use both together.

## Database Questions

### What database does Xano use?
Xano uses PostgreSQL as its underlying database, providing robust relational database capabilities.

### Can I import existing data?
Yes, Xano supports CSV imports, API migrations, and direct database connections for data import.

### How do I create relationships between tables?
Use the visual database designer to create foreign key relationships by linking table fields.

## API Questions

### What API formats does Xano support?
- REST APIs (primary)
- GraphQL
- WebSockets for real-time
- Webhooks for event-driven

### How do I authenticate API requests?
Xano supports multiple authentication methods:
- API keys
- JWT tokens
- OAuth 2.0
- Basic authentication
- Custom authentication

### Can I document my APIs?
Yes, Xano automatically generates Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all your endpoints.

## Function Stack Questions

### What is the Function Stack?
The Function Stack is Xano's visual programming interface where you build logic by connecting function blocks.

### Can I write custom code?
Yes, you can write custom JavaScript functions and integrate them into your Function Stack.

### How do I handle errors?
Use Try/Catch blocks in the Function Stack and configure error responses for each endpoint.

## Integration Questions

### Can Xano connect to external APIs?
Yes, use the External API Request function to connect to any third-party API.

### Does Xano support webhooks?
Yes, both incoming webhooks (to trigger Xano functions) and outgoing webhooks (to notify external systems).

### Can I use Xano with my frontend?
Yes, Xano works with any frontend framework - React, Vue, Angular, Flutter, etc.

## Performance Questions

### How does Xano handle scaling?
Xano automatically scales based on your plan. Enterprise plans include dedicated resources and custom scaling.

### Is there caching?
Yes, Xano includes Redis caching for improved performance.

### What about rate limiting?
Rate limiting is configurable per API endpoint to prevent abuse.

## Security Questions

### Is my data secure?
Yes, Xano provides:
- Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- SOC 2 compliance
- Regular security audits
- Role-based access control

### Can I backup my data?

Yes, Xano includes branching and merging capabilities for version control.

### Is there a testing environment?
Yes, you can create development and staging branches separate from production.

### How do I debug issues?
Xano provides:
- Request history logs
- Function Stack debugger
- Real-time execution monitoring
- Error tracking

## Pricing Questions

### Is there a free tier?
Yes, Xano offers a free tier with limited resources for testing and small projects.

### What happens if I exceed limits?
You'll receive notifications to upgrade. Xano doesn't immediately shut down services.

### Can I self-host Xano?
No, Xano is a cloud-based platform. Enterprise customers can request private cloud deployments.

## Migration from n8n

### Should I replace n8n with Xano?
Not necessarily. They complement each other:
- Use Xano for backend services (database, APIs, auth)
- Use n8n for workflow automation and integrations
- Connect them via APIs

### How do I replicate n8n workflows in Xano?
- HTTP Request nodes → External API Request function
- Database nodes → Native database functions
- Conditionals → If/Then branches in Function Stack
- Loops → For Each function
- Scheduling → Background Tasks with cron

### What n8n features don't exist in Xano?
- Visual workflow designer (Xano uses Function Stack instead)
- Hundreds of pre-built integrations (Xano focuses on custom APIs)
- Self-hosting option

### What Xano features don't exist in n8n?
- Native database management
- User authentication system
- File storage
- API documentation generation
- Real-time WebSocket support

## Best Practices

### How should I structure my database?
- Normalize data to avoid redundancy
- Use proper data types
- Create indexes for frequently queried fields
- Plan relationships before building

### How should I organize my APIs?
- Use RESTful conventions
- Group related endpoints
- Version your APIs (/v1/, /v2/)
- Document all endpoints

### What are common mistakes to avoid?
- Not using transactions for related operations
- Forgetting to add authentication
- Over-fetching data without pagination
- Not handling errors properly
- Ignoring rate limiting
